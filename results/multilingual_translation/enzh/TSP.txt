This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but possess other feather features such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not downy feathers of a chick.

The work was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the process quite strictly.

The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Schneider spoke via video conference from a US Air Force base in his homeland.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in the championship in two individual races.
Her first event was the slalom, in which she received a "Did not Finish" in her first run. 36 out of 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. This made her 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the sit-skiing category did not finish, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered significant head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
"Adekoya has been charged with murder of her son in the meantime before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court."
She is in pre-trial detention until the indictment and trial, but eyewitness statements could be distorted as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a reset of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only wants to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying experiment to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
"It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years."
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
"The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October."
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported. In total, this has caused six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of over 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious"."
The ministry responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also stated that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
"Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists."
Several hostages were rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly individuals, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who are against Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporarily acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents stated that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as three medley relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his many complaints.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because they are prohibited at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
When comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness".
It is speculated that he could run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation will be provided and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the concern about the lack of transportation options, the probability grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be manufactured very thinly and glued onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, then you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view somewhat.
It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service that the bicycle has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
"It has brought us the railway, the car, and many other means of transportation."
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are equally deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger doesn't sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence made up of growled words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey using their sense of smell. They sniff around where the prey has been on the ground.
"You can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey."
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river or if they relocate to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population requires different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While the majority of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. Rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold communal banquets where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Courts of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered as the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such great importance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
So it is possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the American and French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture that is shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the federal contract, which consisted only of the Congress.
"The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate."
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly consists of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored until 1976, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more important is that its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35mm format confusingly measures 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while preserving a degree of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally into thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
"His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the common citizen."
One of the important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the churches exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally recognized international law that had been codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each period in China and each family that held power was its own dynasty.
There were also unstable times of divided provinces between the individual dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the fight for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to a ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on social class, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
One can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramid structures that were built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "strike-through" symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom line missing.
Upward means starting at the top and pushing the bow. Downward means starting at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
Applying generates a usually softer sound, while scraping is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but please remember that the printed sheet music markings are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
"They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were shouting threats against the king and queen."
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the angry crowd swung the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
"They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."
Of course, the superprofits that resulted from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad spectrum of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. Firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One could argue that the automobile is inevitably linked to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and because they were in harmony with the society's place, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the time between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the styles in the West are lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Demand-oriented agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological cultivation method that uses saved, locally adapted seeds in the eco-region and combines them with shifting cultivation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others based on the age, ethnic background, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was raised entirely by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain steps of work that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
"For us, the system of care accommodation is a piece of security for these children."
"Our foster family system aims to provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare."
The foster home should cover all the needs that they did not receive in the home they were taken from.
The internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the approach to benefits and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in their facial expression.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still accurately assess people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences if it is neglected: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do it today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who hits the snooze button in your sleep, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of fluid (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, history, and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be fought in reality through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy was traditionally to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas. The goats were taken care of by goat herders, similar to the more well-known shepherds; often they were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, they built mining railways in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Quite early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, gradually the realization prevailed that rails carrying a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't want just temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the times.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of poisoning by ingestion can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are highly adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that the likelihood of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin language.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often rely to a significant extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Certain behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can execute free-running cycles for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material in question, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is connected in a certain way to a transport system that is based on private cars and supports it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems lead to such shortcomings, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to easily avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small shelters in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
"That seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?"
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans through the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This rather corresponded to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists entirely of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Accordingly, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has taken a back seat, so it has been pushed back in its status and usage.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split again, a portion of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay even with little or no external stimulus.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is referred to as the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
"It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands."
On the near side, there could be more Maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their process of growing up.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
"At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who must do everything differently than the team did and takes ownership of everything."
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that addresses customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, they narrow down the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and result in changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brain.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is frequently used today in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve their writing style in order to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to write smart and interestingly." (Toto, 2004)
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through active reaction to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more distinguish Ontario as what is considered typically Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when rejecting men and don't hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences aside; just because of them, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
"Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco."
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be worth buying a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the Hong Kong territory and is the center of attention for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and take a trip to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonists have made their own. If you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the hinterland of Bangladesh and India to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and according to estimates, there are now around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses depart all day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the release for traffic only took place in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year here.
You can find information about competitions and sales points for polo match tickets at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and US currency may be accepted; inquire in advance with the owners about which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority's instructions, visitors should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may seem, it can still happen that they will attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and pay attention to keeping a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous standoff of the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland stretches over two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but perhaps the New Zealand and Australian wines are more easily tolerated.
The local tap water can be safely consumed, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of a coffee called 'Flat White' is foreign. A small black coffee is called 'Espresso', a cappuccino is filled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs, and especially focus on safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the beach and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that music is still played until late at night on parts of the festival, even if the music has already stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as breaking through ice can cause quite terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to encourage them to spend a lot of money. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can sometimes be difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and ensure that they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that one can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common usage, the term Safari refers to a land journey to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, after already being the host city for the 1964 Games.
"If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation."
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled, due to the coronavirus.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket costing approximately 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothing can help with drying. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards even if you are not present in the room.
If an iron is not available or one does not want to wear ironed socks, one can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, or even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans with force are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and consumption taxes at certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is probably the biggest driving challenge as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp curves are predominant here.
The indicated speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria, they are quite hearty and varied, just like in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being cooked into pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. Javanese people prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar), and a range of aromatic spices as flavor enhancers.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of riders that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
"They provide the rider with more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them."
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with their foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle when pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities for this purpose.
Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to their feet and slides down a snow-covered slope.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include the latter as it is performed in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly longer distances than when hiking - only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if they want to travel through multiple countries.
However, the Schengen area works a little bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition for what items produced are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations, where the age limit can be lower in areas like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be referred to as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also significant for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi people bred reindeer on a large scale, but instead lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They mainly kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is mainly used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere, too simplified.
"Unwetter" is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include, among others, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to pay attention to any type of severe weather affecting their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"A web search for 'course on hostile environments' will likely display the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals about surviving in the wilderness, but only a few publications about war zones.
Travelers who are planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through scanners before their operation.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that have broken on the beach, often found near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topology, the flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there all the way to deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
When you come out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
The reverse culture shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own cultural background.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and shed some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it's quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Further islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula that is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula transition here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 meters in height.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice long-distance connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan to take a year off is to participate in study and course programs abroad.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in an overseas bridging year program can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, every sixth or eighth person owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning and spending the night on the ship.
"If you only go ashore during the shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009)."
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of any age and from any walk of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: This is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about the functioning of airplanes and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often time is a very important factor for business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but difficulties arose on other routes and with smaller companies.
If they sent things by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow luggage to be shipped without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method to fly in first or business class is to fork over a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or even better, to get your own company to cover the costs).
However, it is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats even on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
"Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts."
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
"Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub."
The former ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive, and bustling business center located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It's worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
In the north and in close proximity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit in the north the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (place of pilgrimage) - a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that essentially you are visiting a mass grave site as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many others with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Normal announcements in the metro are exclusively made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, one can navigate Paris best by presenting oneself in the best possible light and behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly facilitate getting around.
The brusque exterior of Parisians disappears very quickly when you display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils, and alternating elevations, it has a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillies as well as many generally more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knee and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are wrap skirts available for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach above the knee.
These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men, there is one size fits all!
The Mallorcan cuisine is based, like in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns always begin with a capital letter next to the word 'you' in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "dear", whereas carro means "chariot".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand formulations.
When speaking a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak some Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is so similar that they don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the problem during their peak that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen."
If you visit a formally designed garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where one can easily navigate and buy almost anything upon arrival.
As you are located in the extreme tropics and just a few degrees north of the equator, you must be prepared for both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for vacation planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
"They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes."
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted around the world by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night at some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with community celebrations often beginning at midnight, during which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are considered common business attire and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
The harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees have to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to unconditionally follow their bosses' instructions.
