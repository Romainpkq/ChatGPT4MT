This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs were covered in feathers, an already widely spread hypothesis, but also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown-chestnut on the upper part, with a light or orange color on the lower part.
The discovery also provides a perspective on how bird feathers have evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but have other characteristic elements of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy feathers of a chick.

Brightness and rotation are combined to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic inversions.

"The work submitted was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to encourage observation of the Sagittarius galaxy."
The effect that the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter in a galaxy is localized around the galaxy like an aura and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of some large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a somewhat technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper on which they indicate which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they leave the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Huhne and Pryce are due to appear in front of Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16th.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned while aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has continuous pain, cannot see with one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and has a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider's testimony was taken through a video link from a USAF base located in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first test he participated in was slalom, where he did not reach the finish line on his first attempt. 36 out of the 116 competitors obtained the same result in that race.
In the other competition she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the seated position event failed to complete their run, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accusations are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later on, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of killing her son at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered, as her image was widely publicized.
"This is a common practice in other areas of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing photographs can be harmful."
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects'."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, has informed journalists that it will not make any further comments at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute regarding borders, which Palestine wants to be drawn based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Old topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, it should have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the AP agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by forest rangers, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Hunters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been recruited based on the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety training and preparation.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in front of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), composed of nine members.
This is the fifth Prime Minister of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
"The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October."
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods that malfunctioned have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) declared that it was aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company said were 'not serious'."
"The Ministry responded, stating that Apple's delay is 'truly regrettable'."
The earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at local time 07:19 (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands declared that no damages have been reported in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
More hostages have been saved and so far the death of at least six has been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographs replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She followed obstetrics studies and in 1959 started working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, commonly known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
"The wrestling brothers also paid tribute to Luna."
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died two months ago. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, also known as "Goldust," commented that "The moon was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more... I love it and I will miss it... I hope it's in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard supported during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II comes to an end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wishing for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the ends of the survey, 29% of those questioned believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition was put into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to control the pain, as they were prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people have verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, began his governance at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to cover shorter distances, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more precise information to pilots.
There are no additional means of transportation available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking lots and public transportation facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of transportation means have brought up the possibility of organizing the game behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between the endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two powders, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball from them.
The moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Rome, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
A huge rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the wheel has offered us is to provide much simpler and faster transportation.
"He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation."
Below them we have several medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small felines (including free pet cats) that eat the more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each feline has their own role to fulfill, so they are not in competition with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Families are composed of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, make long jumps, and can exert a force five times greater than that of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not similar to the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather to a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to consume small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment, then pouncing on their prey.
"When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island from where it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than the one it was in before."
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to show less and less similarity to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say that they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e. release from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, having nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like a blade, along with a supplementary set in the roof of his mouth, which means that nothing that came in his way escaped unscathed.
We are not sure, but it could have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it is even possible that it was cannibalistic.
Also, it attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have stood up to it.
While most of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes that included wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called "pârș".
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to have banquets where they lay on one side while eating.
The ancient Roman cuisine could not include dishes that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People were offering sacrifices to the gods, while priests were trying to respond to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
"In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important."
The majority of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just counters that opened onto the street. Stone was used in house construction.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for a crime and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences regarding the population, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
"If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence."
However, it's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a map of a treasure.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words can be read: 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is known, however, that at its beginnings, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been kept rolled up.
Therefore, the marking was probably made simply for labeling.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was led by the French from Vichy. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being named 'Operation Dragoon'."
In just two weeks, American forces alongside the Free French had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines to some extent the size of society.
The translated sentence is: "The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and reasonable dissemination."
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
Also, he did not have the authority to cancel laws and fiscal tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be modified, and the states treated the central government with such ease that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, along with the German national football team, are ranked second in the list of the most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 races.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan took place a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of indigenous cereals and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
This product is still available nowadays, but more importantly, its proportions have been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
"The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image."
According to it, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether the principle was truly respected.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be efficient, interrupting the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated the provisions of generally accepted international law, inscribed in several international agreements signed in the last two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean zones, even endangering neutral vessels.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the ongoing World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work for Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Additionally, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The most well-known period of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient China's history, with thousands of people dying while fighting to occupy the throne in the magnificent palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican one, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same goes for the military, because instead of a hierarchy based on class, they now rely on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira", located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
"The 'upward stroke' marking looks like a V, while the 'downward stroke' marking looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side."
Up means you have to start from the top and push the bow; down means you have to start from the frog (the part where you grip the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bow stroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bowing are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats towards the king and queen.
"The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open."
At one point, someone from the crowd lifted the head of a member of the royal guard, who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support a large part of the expenses and interest related to the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that includes the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a corresponding logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which results in the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
"In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances during that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
From a historical point of view, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar thinking, who feel excluded by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "unruly" or wild. Some wild children have been kidnapped by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents, because of severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.
It is possible that feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; while others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
"Chairs can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of chair, but so is the small clip art chair in Microsoft Office."
Virtual tutorials are included in the software, with the role of questioning, providing hints, and explaining procedures that could otherwise be too complicated for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extending to extortion.
There shouldn't be children who grow up in an environment where they lack food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education, and reliable medical assistance.
Family care is assumed to cover the needs of children that were not met in the previous household.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approaching types of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He suggests, even, that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research of the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection eliminates them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so brings serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees of today's savannas.
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Older biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which have diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in someone's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is represented by Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energetic channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. However, after the war, clashes in systems, processes, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries."
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It is expected to last forty years and will be fought seriously, by "delegated" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became almost useless overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union were put in motion, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one part of the oceans to another.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using primarily submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The cultures and tribes of ancient times began to keep them near their homes in order to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonway roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
Fishplates were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
"This has become a widespread practice, however, iron has led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons."
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people began to walk in an upright position about 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, usually did not walk in an upright position.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have already walked bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the ecological movement and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly as a result of scientific and technological progress, and the problems are now greater due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few streets away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as the 'Dunlap posters'."
On July 8th, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
Una was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
In birds, many characteristics similar to dinosaurs can still be seen.
"On their feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex."
In practice, all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and the name for these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best clue for internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Please refer to the label for first aid instructions regarding that specific poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term has its origin in the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to life in their host's home.
In the United States of America, there are almost 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the likelihood of developing MS compared to men.
A couple can come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in the majority of scientific research.
"It is not the only one, however, experimentation and an experiment represent a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, addressing questions and making observations also guide scientific research."
Naturalists and philosophers have predominantly used classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language decreased, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which do not represent simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out, one marking the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other marking its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism centered around nature exploration attracts individuals interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the scenery, including wild animals and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and learning more information about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave by car from the small villages in the countryside to go to their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this carbon-intensive economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or bridge collapse are rarely encountered.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Could it be because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
The traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the way they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain reasonably constant within limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This offers her a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
In our days, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some considered that he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory according to which everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air, and fire.
He reminded me more quickly of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they transform into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys may also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing tools have emerged, the pencil has lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to put their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decompose with a small impulse or without impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the nearby part and 100 km in the distant part.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in higher relief areas.
There may be more magma in the nearby area, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during development until maturity.
These theories study what determines some people to want to do what they do and what in their surrounding environment can determine them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behaviors can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people transform into unrecognizable individuals who believe that they need to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they belong to.
"Often they have more autonomy than members of a conventional team, as their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership."
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also represents a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
"When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely."
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The data from neurobiology represent physical evidence that forms the basis of a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows for narrowing the scope of research and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves the manufacturing of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, but it has also been used in a few software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would be pleased to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
The virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year the website is remodeled, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
"Additionally, blogging 'forces students to be more aware of the surrounding world.' The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
"Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their studies far beyond the usual school day."
"The proper use of blogs can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, offering a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while the north hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka district and many others.
"These and many others highlight Ontario as being representative of what foreigners consider Canadian excellence."
Large portions towards the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that have the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true standalone continent when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam in those regions, which had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders with the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but it should not appear expensive.
Women must be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you refuse a man and do not be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being named Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leather objects, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the central area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, it requires an effort to gather information in order to understand the status of the ongoing fights in North Kivu province for visits outside the city.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and also offers some of the cheapest trips to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
For getting around Goma, one can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places.
In modern times, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in strong contrast with the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arab flair than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a series of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory Hong Kong is given by the island of Hong Kong and it is the place that many tourists see as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a shining bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crowded on reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers took for themselves and, therefore, for those who are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/marshland.
Starting in 1966, Sundarbans became a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
"Because buses that connect districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance."
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters width.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
"The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed."
Guaraní represented the most important indigenous population group that lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also hosted other indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of the Indies," was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has preserved, with efforts, a good part of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is established as equivalent to 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will be accepted, in general, everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards probably won't be accepted, although they will likely accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it is best to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strongly scented foods and keep the camping area clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sad naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located between two ports. The most famous of these are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most of them have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata harbor, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but New Zealand or Australian ones would be better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an "espresso", cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are spicy in terms of price, but very good.
Many people visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cutie medusa is encountered near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides the traveler with peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
Additionally, they can hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any modifications or requests must be addressed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to catch a camping spot near the music.
Remember that, although the music from the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of your cabin, as navigating through ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
The cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the obligation to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers here and the money they spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
Usually, they have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the good mood and guests staying in the venue.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, drinking affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to remain sober.
Whoever will drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes must take into consideration the possible presence of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you cannot drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic mostly runs uninterrupted throughout the year.
Probably safaris are the main tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to land journeys undertaken to see the amazing wild animals of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good visibility of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
"A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "on foot") consists of hikes, either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you have booked plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a complicated situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, the cancellation policies due to coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets for events will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Stepping on wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't like to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material heat up too much (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
"In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others, several minutes are necessary."
The filters differ in their level of efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider the option of buying water in closed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter pests with which they are not familiar at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill a person using physical force are generally not considered harmful.
The duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who are planning to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging traffic conditions along the entire length of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves prevail.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is all the more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, quite oddly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular pastries go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastry products, taste what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'liquid' depending on the amount of liquid."
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without any other qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
"These provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety issues, as it is possible for a rider's feet to get stuck in them."
If a rider falls off the saddle but remains with one foot caught on the stirrup, the horse can drag them along when it starts to run. To minimize this risk, a series of precautionary measures can be taken.
First of all, most of those who ride wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who falls off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after place for mountaineering in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer stunning views from their tops. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve skiing down the snow, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums' in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a particular location."
The idea of skiing is extremely old - we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 BC!
The alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Hiking with a backpack on skis: This activity is also known as skiing in unmarked areas, ski touring, or skiing while hiking.
This is a related activity, but one that usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances somewhat longer than by walking - but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa procedures and passport control repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way that resembles a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do it at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, those who have a Schengen visa do not need to obtain a visa for each individual Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that establishes which produced articles are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographic location, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to commerce is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.
"If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance."
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East could face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally, and too simplified, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" is a generic term used for any type of dangerous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather in the area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional preparation.
An internet search for "hostile environment training" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address in much more detail all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
"There are quite a few books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival, but publications that address war zones are few."
Travelers who plan to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports without declaring the sex (X) or updated documents to correspond with the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
The searches at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
The return currents represent the flow of water returning to the ocean from the waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a fast current can form towards the deep waters.
The majority of deaths occur due to exhaustion in the attempt to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move to a position where you are not caught again and, depending on your abilities and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests more quickly than the cultural shock (the honeymoon euphoria persists less), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes encounter significant difficulties when readapting to their native culture.
If you were to return home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When they had just left for abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, aware that visiting a new country involves a process of adaptation.
The world doesn't always expect patience and understanding to be necessary towards travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually, one can constantly hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sound and light seems to be taken from a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the southern part of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula come together to give birth to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4892 m.
"In isolated places without phone signal, a satellite phone could be your only option."
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a cell phone because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is widely used in maritime transport, including recreational boats, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
The local telephone service provider could give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people who plan a year off is to combine travel with study.
This is a popular activity, especially among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending university without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of deferred courses abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
"Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast."
"In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht."
Although the archipelagos off the coasts and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight residents.
This happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to 40).
Most Baltic cruises offered provide an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days in a row, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only travel on land during excursions on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruise brochures present Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things, which many people experience.
"For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control."
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential when it comes to documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but smaller companies and other routes had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it may take days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it pass faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, it's not worth looking for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which case they charge fares according to demand.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern region of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, and modern commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, alongside buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red tile roofs from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known outside the country after an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb bus 403 runs regularly towards Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern part, you can also visit the Sanctuary of the Holy Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Saint Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are kindly requested to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Please do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on the existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, the majority of signs are only made in Catalan, because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation, along with other services.
The periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, impolite, and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not conform to reality, in order to have a pleasant stay in Paris, it is good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will help you to get by much more easily.
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly transforms into a friendly one if you demonstrate a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir, and spruce trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different types of soils, and altitude levels.
The region also shelters an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and mountain cock can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
"And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!"
The cuisine in Majorca, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used abundantly.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Also, undoubtedly, it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility that a verb or adjective can be used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, with most of them being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to be more careful with are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, someone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may jump to the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
The pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational places.
"As during their glory days light pollution was not as big of a problem as it is nowadays, they are usually located in cities or campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our times."
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants do not look better anywhere than in their natural environment, so do not succumb to the temptation of picking even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive there.
While being in the "upper tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, less often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the place where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, alongside their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Internal navigable waters can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles on the Loire Valley, on the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
He also defines the routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition, there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals have not been able to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main animal that grazes in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the areas in the Arctic or Antarctica during winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
"Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars."
The Japanese work culture has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Costumes represent the standard attire in the business environment, and coworkers address each other using their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, emphasizing group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
