This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has already been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the top of the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown, while the bottom is light or carrot-colored.
This discovery also helps to deepen our understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed central shaft, called the "rachis," but they did have other feather features such as barbs and barbules. Researchers suggest that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of feathers indicates that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not juvenile ones.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the downy feathers of a hatchling.

After comparison through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it was found that the composition of these crystals matched the crystal components found in the urine of affected pets.
"I don't know if you are aware, but most of the goods imported from Central America to this country are duty-free."
However, 80% of our products are subject to tariffs in Central American countries. ... We treat you.
"I think this is completely unreasonable; obviously unfair."
What I say to people is: treat us the way we treat you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill stipulates that violent electronic games sold in California must be labeled with "18", and each time a seller violates the law by selling to a minor, they will be fined $1000.
Director of Public Prosecutions and Royal Legal Advisor Kier Starmer announced this morning that charges will be brought against Huna and Praise.
Huhne has resigned and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take over the vacant position of Business Secretary left by Davey.
Huna and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla's arms and chin were injured, while Kristoffer Schneider needs facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it was pointed at the fifth person. Schneider was in great pain, one eye was blinded, a piece of skull was missing, and his face had to be reshaped using titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link from a United States Air Force (USAF) base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's game, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions of the championship.
Her first project was obstacle skiing, and she ended the competition with an "incomplete" score in the first round. 36 of the 116 participants in the competition achieved the same score.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she ranked tenth in the women's standing position group with a total score of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-ranked Austrian player Claudia Rausch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-ranked Hungarian player Gong Ji Dani.
Four female skiers in the sitting group did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event failed to make it onto the leaderboard.
The central state police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent of Police D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people for raping this Swiss woman and have also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Qian Dela Shekar Solanji said that the defendants covered their faces when they appeared in court.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head suffered a serious injury.
"The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescue personnel have rescued the driver from the red Audi TT."
At first, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adekya was charged with murdering her son and was tried in the Edinburgh Court of Justice.
She has been detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any witness testimony may be negatively affected as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's judicial system is different, and the court believes that publishing photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out that "if journalists publish photos and other information about suspects, there does seem to be a risk."
"The main department responsible for prosecution, the Royal Prosecution Service, stated to reporters that they will not make any further comments at least until the prosecution is initiated."
According to reports, this document will mention the border dispute, and Palestine hopes to use the borders before the 1967 Middle East War as a basis.
According to reports, other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to deploy military forces in the central valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to retain them for five years.
The forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary experiment for pest control, as the experiment will be monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales (NSW) Shooting Association, the Shooting Association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Management at the New South Wales National Park and Wildlife Service (NPWS), stated that the four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new temporary electoral council (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth selection to Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission suggested that the former CEP resign, which is part of the measures to push the country towards new elections.
The committee is a response from Martelly to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protest activities have been triggered by some elections that have failed to take place as scheduled, and sometimes protests escalate into violent incidents.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they have noticed 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating to the department, despite the company claiming that these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy and Industry responded by saying that it is "very regrettable" that Apple has postponed the release of the report.
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that according to reports, there have been no disaster losses domestically.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila and took Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and elderly) and the Filipino photographers were released in advance.
Two photographers then replaced an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendosa was then shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and has been working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland since 1959.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research shows that the application of hormones can accelerate the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
According to Xinhua News Agency, government investigators discovered two "black boxes" flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first lady of extreme, my first manager. Luna passed away on a full moon night. Such a night was as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (also known as "Goldust") commented, "Luna and I were both hard to figure out... she may have been even harder to figure out... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey was conducted before the 2010 federal election with 1,400 respondents, and the number of respondents who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who was in charge of the government, said that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicated.
34% of respondents unanimously expressed their hope that Queen Elizabeth II would become the last monarch of Australia.
There is a polarization in voting, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition has been constantly questioned.
He was unable to relieve his pain with medication because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In early February, several people used different hardware and software to verify this discovery and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain the continuity of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed since the collision between comets and Earth a long time ago, especially the way Earth was formed.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to rumors as "political chatter and foolish behavior."
It is speculated that he will participate in the presidential election in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States stated that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes for airplanes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information."
There are no additional transportation options, and the overground train does not stop at Wembley. There are also no parking lots or facilities for parking and transferring.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to be held behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a research report published in the journal Science stated that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the invasive cactus finch, despite the belief that this process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin threads for wrapping and weaving, or pounded and rolled into flat pieces.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. Because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "colorful hand-copied books".
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is represented by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H) in the chemical being measured.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir two types of dry powder to mix them, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a shell-like substance, which feels very interesting.
The two cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every household equipped with flush toilets, which were connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Remains of a sewage system were found in houses in the cities of Knossos on the island of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of mixed-gender public baths.
"When you make a phone call to someone far away thousands of miles, you will use a satellite."
After receiving a phone call in space, the satellite almost immediately reflects it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes certain light and vision to be distorted.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. Its greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits, antelopes to deer.
In the end, many small feline animals (including free-roaming pet cats) feed on a much larger quantity of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The lion group consists of one to three adult male lions with a family relationship, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a big family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals exhibit remarkably similar behavior to lions (but unlike other large felines), and this behavior is also deadly for their prey.
Tigers are versatile athletes, they can climb (although their climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump far, and their pulling strength can reach five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only members of the Felidae family that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as the roar of a lion, but more like an angry howl of words.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of leopard cats is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the ocelot tracks and hunts prey on the ground by using its sense of smell and tracking the animal's scent.
Their night vision is very strong, they can see clearly in the dark, and their movements are very stealthy. The hunting method of the leopard cat is to blend into the surrounding environment first, and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (such as crossing mountains and rivers, or arriving on a new island where it is not easy to return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptabilities to become a strong competitor, rather than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time goes by, new populations begin to adapt to new environments, and they start to become increasingly dissimilar from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually appear completely different, to the point where they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and is also a crucial part of evolution.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Blue Dragon was the top predator of that era, and it feared nothing except for its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there is also a row of teeth on the upper jaw. This means that anything that encounters it will have nowhere to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, and we are not yet certain about this. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other sea dragons, and it may even eat humans.
"It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it."
Although most of the food of the Romans is familiar to us, they do have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women sit on chairs to eat, while rich people prefer to gather together and hold banquets, eating while reclining.
Foods that were introduced from the Americas or Asia into Europe several centuries later could not have appeared in the diet of ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, considering it as the dwelling place of that god.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has a courtyard that is open to the public and an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some special towers are in the shape of a pyramid and are called pyramid-shaped pagodas, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special holy place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not very important.
Hebrew families spend most of their lives outdoors.
Women are cooking in the yard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan does not have large forests, so wood is very expensive.
The population of Greenland is sparse. According to the Nordic epic Saga of the Icelanders, Eric the Red, who was exiled from Iceland for murder, sailed west and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
"But regardless of whether he noticed or not, the Inuit people were already living there at that time."
Although they all belong to "Scandinavia", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure", you may think that there is a treasure map on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
However, the reality is not so. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" in reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been stored rolled up when it was first written.
Therefore, it is very likely that this symbol was only added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These French people reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and did not resist the invaders, but instead cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, and this attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the armies of the United States and Free France liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a population (society) that lives and works together cooperatively.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "of or pertaining to citizens"), and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "state"), which in some way define the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization-based culture means the passing down of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering presence of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without a trace without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not considered as decent civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
The Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national administrative or judicial department, the Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, but state governments often do not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These terms must be modified with the unanimous consent of all states, but the attitudes of the states towards the central government are very disrespectful, to the extent that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, and they won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the numerous islands in Japan, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
The West's understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest region of Taiwan, and began to change the indigenous people's way of producing food, while hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan. In 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
In order to allow tourists to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued until today.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of film photography.
"Today, it is still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors."
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which can be a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (when divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same aspect ratio or are very close to it.
The frequently abused and ridiculed rule of thirds, when used to create dynamic compositions, can serve as a simple guiding method and help maintain order in the image.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection point of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of various European countries are different, for over a thousand years, Christianity has connected them together.
"From the king to the common people, its power spreads throughout the ten directions and influences everyone."
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically established for this purpose.
The centralized power system in the church existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether they have followed this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
"They cut off the supply of vital military and civilian goods. The fact proves that this strategy is effective, although such a blockade violates the universally accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries."
Britain is laying mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even posing a threat to neutral ships.
"Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare."
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the brutality and devastation of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at Edison Machine Works in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, written to Thomas Edison.
Each period of ancient China has its own characteristics; each era or dynasty that ruled the country had a distinct feature.
Similarly, during the changes of dynasties throughout history, it was a period of instability with small states dividing. The most famous of these was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms, which was between the transitions of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various warlords engaged in fierce battles to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest power in the luxurious palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not only to the rulers but also to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open for application to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise to the top.
The military is the same, because the rank is no longer based on hierarchy, but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed is very interested in things beyond worldly life. He used to frequently go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself not only withstood the test of time and remained intact, but also brought extremely vivid images to Muhammad's spiritual intention.
The cave is located on a mountain top in the northern part of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, one can hardly see or hear anything from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only building among the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece created by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids built to pay tribute to the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt (also known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex") includes multiple pyramids (with the largest being the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The symbol for "up-bow" looks like the letter V, while the symbol for "down-bow" looks like a nail or a square missing its bottom edge.
"Upward refers to pushing the bow from the top, while downward refers to pulling the bow from the bow grip (the place where the hand holds the bow)."
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow produces a stronger and more firm sound.
Please feel free to use a pencil to make your own markings, but remember that the printed notes have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister Madame Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris by a group of market women from Versailles.
"They rode in a carriage back to Paris, where a group of people surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen."
The mob forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of the carriage.
In front of the terrified queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
During the conquest of the Philippines, the war expenses of American imperialism were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, which covered most of the expenses, as well as the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is necessary to understand the background that led to the establishment of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the event occurred is usually referred to as the heyday of European history, namely the period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the heyday of the Middle Ages was the early Middle Ages, and after that was the late Middle Ages. It is conventionally believed that the late Middle Ages ended around 1500.
The technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition that states that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself largely surpasses cultural or political influences, and second, technology in turn will have an inherent "impact" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to build a national highway network for only a small number of cars, so a new production method has emerged to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high number of Volkswagen cars on the road will lead to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for treating injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism color. This is due to writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Against the backdrop of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge. These customs and cultures are much better than any imposed laws because they harmoniously blend with the place where society is located.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine market.
It was precisely at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages approached its end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advancements at the time was that, after the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is an agricultural activity carried out to produce only enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that utilizes local seeds preserved within the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, in order to maximize yield.
From a historical perspective, the majority of farmers have engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, this situation still exists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, who feel ignored by societal norms. Subcultures cultivate a sense of identity among them.
Given the differences in age, race, class, position, and/or gender among members, subcultures may have their own unique characteristics.
The distinctive traits that make subcultures different may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultures often symbolically use unique styles of behavior to indicate their membership identity, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not achieve socialization with the help of adults during their growth process.
Children like this are called "wild children", meaning feral children. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept their intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals, while others live alone in the wilderness.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of their physical abilities) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning goes even further.
"Bracket-style teaching is not a learning method, but a means of assisting people who have just learned to use new computer programs or start new projects."
Bracket teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of bracket teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software to question, prompt, and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without manners, care, and education, but unfortunately, it often happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
"Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care."
The foster care system should provide all the essential items that are lacking in the child's original family.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet add extra dimensions to its uses and ways of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying the audience's reaction to websites, Aimee and McKee (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that the ability to understand human behavior may be a common skill among animals such as pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of gene mutations: dominant and recessive.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to segregation and recombination, mutations fluctuate between the two gene pools in each generation.
On the tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, but the existing plant resources are insufficient to meet their amino acid needs.
In addition, if this cannot be achieved, it will bring serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately lead to death.
The easiest plant-based resources to obtain should be protein from leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest this type of protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In summary, if our ancestors used the same methods as the chimpanzees in the tropical grasslands to solve the "protein problem", we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to achieve by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that allows you to wake up without being fully disturbed.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other choices based on biological rhythms include drinking a lot of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea - known to have a diuretic effect) and forcing oneself to get up and urinate.
The degree of inner peace in a person is opposite to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The smaller the pressure, the more active the vitality is expressed. Everyone has the possibility of finding absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky Yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, activating chakras, one can reach the state of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, after the war, conflicts in terms of systems, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to go their separate ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war lasted for 40 years, and proxy armies fought with real guns and knives on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense line had already been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and established fortifications in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping has been the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the country's ability to transport personnel and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, with U-boats as its main force, attempted to intercept this transport.
If the Allied Powers had failed at that time, Germany would have likely conquered England just like it did with other European countries.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
Domestic goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other grazing areas, and are typically cared for by goat herders (mostly children or teenagers) who are similar to more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built cart roads as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn tram was made up of parallel wooden planks, it was able to make the horses run faster and carry more weight on the bumpy roads of that time.
Railway sleepers were introduced very early on to fix the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but the iron plates will cause more severe wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was born.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man), humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
People discovered the phenomenon of bipedal specialization in southern ape fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become active environmentalists, reducing future disasters to some extent.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and completely eradicate it.
It is obvious that due to the progress of human science and technology, the world has undergone significant changes, while overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans have made the problem even more serious.
The handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th and then sent to John Dunlap's printing press several blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" version.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read the letter to his army in New York on July 9th. A copy of the letter arrived in London on August 10th.
The remaining 25 Dunlap broadsides, which were printed on one side, are the earliest surviving versions of the document. The handwritten original manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have been living until now, which we call "birds".
Many people believe that they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
"But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs."
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, which are also known as "bits" in computer terminology.
Toxicity in the body may not immediately manifest, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indicator of ingesting poison may be the opened container found on the scene, containing medication or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison to obtain specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term originated from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are a type of insect that is highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the assassin bug and the stink bug are nest-dwelling insects that are adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), and this disease has become a major neurological disease among middle-aged and young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may develop adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that another couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use scientific methods to discover the way the world operates. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
"Experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but it is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research."
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all fields of science (including psychology) have been accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has departed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers are largely determined by the endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their existence.
The periodic rhythm is not just a simple response to external periodic signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to operate for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence that demonstrates DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophage, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the bacteriophage.
Mutations can produce various different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural scenery tourism industry attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas, and they come to observe natural landscapes including wildlife and plants.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park, and studying the ecosystem.
For example, visit, film, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from the small town to go to work, and the workplaces of the people they pass by on the way are exactly where they are leaving.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is connected to the private car-based transportation system in some way and supports it.
Nowadays, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain a stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years.
Every person is a member of society and will use the transportation system. However, almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of a similar magnitude.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they malfunction every day? Are the traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of traffic flow focuses on the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is very difficult because it is impossible to make 100% accurate predictions about driver behavior.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers often falls within a reasonable range of consistency, so traffic flow often exhibits a certain degree of reasonable consistency that can be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them more small area space to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many people who hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and that the sun (and even other stars) do too.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and also the largest. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total volume of water that flows into the sea from all rivers in the world.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and advanced construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors that had a history of over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most people working in the country on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements can be found in their natural form in nature and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
Alloys are basically composed of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget one thing, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements belong to metals, and silver and gold are also metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is composed of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was introduced, it became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils has become increasingly low and their usage has decreased.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only guess what the outcome of the keyboard will be when the updated product appears.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to bring together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy little cart up a mountain. Splitting the atomic nucleus again, and then releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the Earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick, while the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
The crust beneath the dark side is thinner, while the crust beneath the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more shaded areas on the closer side, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the motivation content theory is to find factors that are identifiable or interesting to people.
These theories suggest that when people mature to a certain degree and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
Why do some people want to do what they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things - these theoretical studies.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. One situation is that they will try to maintain an "intimate relationship" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, and also face difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme situation, this person would become a completely different individual, feeling that they must change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of their team.
This kind of behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the liaison point for their corresponding offline teams.
"They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand."
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" refers to the management team to which each member must report. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization need to spend so much time building a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality will occur.
Therefore, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings about new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"The Angel" (2006) interprets the continuous improvement plan as a method that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical methods in cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to establish a simulation model, which helps us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research on artificial intelligence (AI) involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and some household computers and electronic game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important component of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by public transportation.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can watch artificial artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or appreciate exquisite artworks in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a good way to review the itinerary and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but old versions are saved online and used as a reference.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often use sloppy grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
"Students are often the most critical readers, so blog authors start to work hard to improve their writing skills and avoid criticism."
In addition, writing blogs "forces students to have a more insightful view of the world around them." Encouraged by the desire to satisfy their audience's interests, students become smarter and more interesting.
Writing blogs is a tool that can stimulate collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Proper use of blogs can make students more adept at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own position in the context of others' articles and be able to articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, it is charming and uses a bilingual system. The highlight is a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka River and undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All of these factors have made Ontario the typical Canadian image that foreigners think of.
In the vast northern regions, population is sparse, and some places are desolate wilderness without any human habitation.
A surprising comparison of population data: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island and remains a separate continent for wildlife.
Smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine prevails in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part borders the Sahel region; the southern and western parts are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that regardless of their actual marital status, all female tourists should say that they are married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors that they perceive as harassment; and being followed or grabbed is not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, one should be firm and not afraid to stick to their position (regardless of cultural differences, one should decisively refuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids. The port was once called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt this city, naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Near the old city of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs can be seen everywhere, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to investigate before traveling anywhere outside of Goma to find out if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short distance ride is 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is relatively remote, "Tibet" is used to metaphorically refer to distant foreign lands.
Today, although Timgad's reputation has made it a tourist destination and there is an airport, it is still a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of desertification, it was listed on the endangered World Heritage List.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the special program "Wonders of the African World" on the American Public Broadcasting Service.
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic style rather than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River serving as the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wildlife and plants.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park charges conservation fees and entrance fees every day.
Buying a Wild Card has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is also the focal point for many tourists.
The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a sparkling bar chart, particularly striking against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour's waters.
If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so if you want to search for evidence of colonial history in this territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, there are also remnants of huge forests inside, which once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is water bodies/swamp areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses depart from the urban intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most of the buses, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
"Considering that the interval bus is often fully booked, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance."
Most areas can ride on comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
"To go to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way."
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian town of Oiapoque with Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs inspection station is also expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern region of Paraguay, and they lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle of hunting and gathering, as well as engaging in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is the homeland of other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who rely on hunting, gathering, and fishing for their livelihood.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Great Indian Province" and was the result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has always tried to preserve many of the local characteristics and features of the city of Asunción.
Argentina is known for having world-class polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted for payment within Stanley.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but English and American currency can be used; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the island, so it is necessary to exchange it before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the temperature displayed on the thermometer.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park management personnel stated that a distance of at least 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, while a distance of 25 yards/meters should be maintained from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may appear, almost all large animals such as bison, deer, elk, bears, etc. have the potential to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large in size, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, it is important to note that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so it is necessary to avoid carrying or cooking food that emits strong odors and to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle organized by the Mau movement to fight for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three different regions.
The North Shore Beach (located in the North Shore area) is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of here are beaches, swimming is very safe, and most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and various shops line the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is "Number One" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but it is very easy to drink and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Here you can buy many French wines, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may withstand long-distance transportation better.
The local tap water can fully meet the safety drinking standards, but if you are still worried, it is also easy to buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is called "espresso", the cream in a cappuccino is piled high (not foam), and tea is not typically served with milk.
Hot chocolate has reached the Belgian standard. The juice is expensive, but of good quality.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are very few incidents of injuries resulting from participating in any of the aforementioned activities.
Despite this, it is still necessary to follow the advice of relevant departments, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found on the beaches and river mouths near 1770 town between October and April each year. Occasionally, their presence can also be observed at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is not the ocean, but the estuaries in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book other forms of accommodation such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfers, and some even offer packages that include flights and hotel accommodations.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should be handled through the travel agent first, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an extremely important part of the music festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue playing music until late at night.
Some music festivals will set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, it is important to check the location of the cabin, as sailing on ice can cause very scary noise for those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes sightseeing activities within the city. Cruise passengers can obtain visa exemptions (details can be found in the terms of service).

The stirrups hang on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
"They provide better stability for riders, but there are also safety risks because the rider's feet may get stuck."
If a rider is thrown off the horse but one foot is stuck in the stirrup, the horse may drag him while running. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
Firstly, most horse riders wear boots with heels, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - are equipped with safety buckles, so if the rider falls off and pulls backwards, the stirrup leather will come off the saddle.

The sport of alpine skiing includes both regular skiing and snowboarding, and is very popular. In this sport, a snowboard or a single ski is fixed to your feet, and you slide down terrain covered in white snow.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many skiing enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "skiing fanatics," and they plan to ski at a certain location for the entire vacation.
The idea of skiing has a long history - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.

Imagine the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
When the conditions are good, you can go further than walking - but only in very few cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a smooth track.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. In most cases, traveling through multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this aspect, the Schengen area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually pass through the border directly without having to undergo passport checks again at the checkpoint.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and procedures.
There is no unified definition for which processed items are antiques. Some tax authorities define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.

Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although their age is much shorter compared to similar products produced in large quantities.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important to many people who make a living in other professions.
However, even from a traditional perspective, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They make a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and usually use reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are engaged in modern industries. The tourism industry is a major source of income for the Sápmi, which is the Sami region.

You can also consult advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is formulated for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The travel warning can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the advice offered here is often rough, general, and overly simplistic.

The course training usually lasts for 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes also involves armed training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about surviving in war zones are rare.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid identification documents on their return journey.
As for whether or not they are willing to issue passports without specifying gender (X), or whether or not they are willing to change documents to match the desired name and gender, the will of each government varies.
The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign governments varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checks became more troublesome.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy when going through a scanner, and cannot guarantee their own dignity.
Offshore currents are the return flow of waves from the beach to the sea, which usually occur in reefs or similar places.
The underwater terrain causes the backflow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where it may form rapids flowing towards deeper water.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and physical exhaustion, it is unlikely to succeed in swimming against the current.
After getting rid of the turbulent water flow, it's not so difficult to swim back.
Strive to swim to a place where you will not be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered).
The impact of returning to one's homeland is faster (honeymoon period is shorter) and lasts longer, and may also be more severe than cultural shock.

On the backdrop is a sphinx, which is also the narrator of the epic story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, which have the most bases, with sixteen bases in use on the islands in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas".
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island. There, an active volcanic crater was flooded by a flood, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula merge into the plateau here, and then reform into the Ellsworth Mountains, which stretch for 360 kilometers. This mountain range is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Mountains, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
"In remote areas where there is no mobile signal coverage, satellite phones may be your only option."

Finland is an excellent sailing destination, known as the "land of a thousand lakes", and within its lakes and coastal archipelagos there are also thousands of islands.
"Yachts are not necessary in islands and lakes."
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is sufficient to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats and even kayaks can bring a different experience.
Rowing is a national leisure activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but are unique in other ways (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Most typical Baltic Sea cruises will stay in St. Petersburg, Russia for a long time.
This means that there can be several full days to visit this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only disembark during a boat tour, a separate visa is not required (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships highlight Berlin, Germany in their promotional brochures. As seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the cost of touring the city is not included in the cruise price.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience, especially for those who have never flown before or have had painful experiences in the past.

For some people, understanding the principles of how airplanes work and the procedures of flying may be helpful in overcoming fear caused by unknown or uncontrollable situations.
Express delivery companies can earn high rewards for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or parts used for emergency repairs.
On certain routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and small companies, there are problems.
If they transport goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to check it in as baggage. According to airline regulations, it is prohibited to transport luggage of passengers who have not boarded the plane, and you need to be present in this case.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (or, a better way is to have your company pay for your travel).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the ticket price for business class may be four times that of economy class, and the ticket price for first class may be as high as 11 times!
Generally speaking, it's not necessary to look for discounted business or first class tickets when flying directly from A to B.
The airline companies are very aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a high price to obtain the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so the airlines will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Dniester River Republic in the eastern part of Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any United Nations member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been rebuilt.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox.

Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about massacres or Nazis.
Do not make marks or graffiti on buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand it. As for Spanish, almost everyone can understand it.
However, most signs only use Catalan because it is the first official language as required by law.

Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to behave properly and act like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will make it much easier to participate in social activities.
If you show a little bit of basic politeness, the rude behavior of Parisians will quickly disappear without a trace.

This can also make reading easier, although it does make writing more complex to some extent, because you need to determine whether verbs or adjectives are being used as a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because the pronunciation of most words is completely identical to their spelling.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes based on the following vowels.

More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil activities on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, and the congregation usually floods into the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals arrived on these islands by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Because they are far from the mainland, mammals cannot travel long distances to reach the area, making giant tortoises the main herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived at the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you can experience polar night, which is a period of time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark for the entire day.
