Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers -- a theory that's been widely circulated -- but it also provides details that fossils typically don't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carrot-colored on the underside, scientists said.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed backbone -- called a rachis -- but did have other features of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, which the researchers speculate may have evolved later than those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers believe that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature plumage rather than juvenile feathers.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not the down of a juvenile dinosaur.

Police Commissioner Chandra Shekar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency crews pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial; but any witness evidence could be negatively affected because her image has been widely released.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary is different, with courts considering the potential harm that could be caused by publishing the photos.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, said: "There does seem to be a real danger for journalists to publish information such as pictures of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, the main body responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that it would not make any further comments, at least until an indictment was instituted.
It has been revealed that the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to build on before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a ten-year military presence in the valley after the deal was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to keep it for only five years.
Rangers closely monitor shooters participating in supplemental pest control trials, as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the National Parks Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Australian Shooters Association (NSW), the Shooters Association has recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting programme.
Mick O'flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage management at the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), said the four gunmen selected for the first shooting had received a full range of investigations. Safety and training guidance.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has been elected to Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Last month, a presidential council recommended that the former CEP resign as part of measures to push the country toward new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, the protests have sometimes escalated into violence after some elections failed to take place as scheduled.
About 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning and overheating were reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had noticed 27 incidents involving the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified the ministry of another 34 accidents caused by overheating, although the company said the accidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that Apple's delay in releasing the report was "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported domestically.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center) also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila and took Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raises his M16 rifle and shoots at tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Two photographers then cover for an elderly woman who needs to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
Liggins began researching preterm births in his spare time while working in a hospital.
His research showed that administering hormones can speed up the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamcatcher said: "Luna was the first Supreme Queen, my first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A night like this was as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (nicknamed "The Sands") commented: "Luna is as elusive as I am...she might be even more elusive...I love her and miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place."
Opposition to Australia as a republic has grown by 8 per cent since 2008, according to a survey of 1,400 respondents ahead of the 2010 federal election.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicated.
34% of respondents unanimously said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Voting was polarized, with 29 per cent of respondents saying Australia should be republiced as soon as possible and 31 per cent saying Australia should never be republicd.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the Commonwealth Games triple relay, but his fitness has been questioned over his complaints.
He has been unable to take medication for pain relief because the competition forbids competitors from taking them.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on Jan. 25.
In early February, several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water and organic matter on Earth that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to understand how planets, especially Earth, have formed since a comet collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been governor since the start of the year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political whims and follies."
He is speculated to be running for president in 2016.
Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen) could allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions, according to the FAA.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transport, the Overground train does not stop at Wembley, and there are no overground car parks or park and ride facilities.
Matches could be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters amid concerns over a lack of transport.
A new species of bird has formed in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Darwin's finch, and the exotic cactus toucan, Although the process is believed to take longer.
Gold can be worked into various shapes. Can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into filaments for winding and braiding. It can also be pounded or crushed into flakes.
It can be made very thin, glued to other metals, and, being so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted drawings in books known as "coloured manuscripts."
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
pH is expressed as the number of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being measured.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders to combine, then use clean wet hands to form them into a ball.
The moisture from your hands reacts with the outer layer, which creates something like a crust, which is kind of interesting.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household has a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete, Greece, and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed public baths.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
Satellites in space pick up the call and reflect it back almost immediately.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a massive rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest contribution of wheels to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope to deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that feed on a far greater number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a special job, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most gregarious cat species, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related adult males, and up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in extended families, females are usually closely related to each other.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals behave eerily similar to lions (but unlike other big cats), and these behaviors can also be deadly to their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete, it can climb (although the climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump long, and can pull five times as much as a human Hercules.
Tigers are of the same type (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as deep as a lion's, but more like an angry growl.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. When conditions permit, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all ocelot prey are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that leopard cats track and find prey by smelling and sniffing for prey's tracks on the ground.
They have excellent night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and are stealthy in action. The way ocelots prey is to blend into their surroundings and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) separates from their original main population (such as they cross mountains and rivers, or they arrive at a new island where easy return is not possible), they often find themselves in The environment is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time went on, the new populations began to adapt to the new environment, and they began to look less and less like other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "speciation," the formation of new species. Speciation is the inevitable result of evolution, and it is also an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing but its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there is another row on the upper jaw. This means that anything that meets it has nowhere to go.
It's possible the tongue was forked, we're not sure yet. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although most of the food the Romans ate was familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called the dormouse
Another difference is that poor people and women eat while sitting on chairs, while rich people like to gather for banquets and eat on their sides.
Foods that came to Europe centuries later from the Americas or Asia could not have been included in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, seeing it as the god's dwelling place.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has a courtyard that is open to the public, and an inner sanctum that only priests can enter.
Some special towers are pyramid-shaped, called ziggurats, and were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special shrine to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house is not very important.
The life of a Hebrew family is mostly spent outdoors.
The women cook in the courtyard; the shop is essentially an open counter facing the street. They use stones to build their houses.
There are no big forests in Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Nordic epic Saga, Eric the Red Beard was expelled from Iceland for murder. He sailed west and found land, so he named it Greenland.
But whether he found it or not, the Eskimos were already living there.
Although all part of "Scandinavia," there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you probably thought there would be a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one has been able to identify the author, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been stored on a roll when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol was only added as a label.
D-Day and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These Frenchmen made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and did not fight against the invaders, but cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in an offensive known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by groups of people (society) who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" ("citizen"), related to both the Latin "civis" ("citizen") and "civitas" ("city" or "city-state") , which also somehow defines the size of the society.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation. A civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering presence of cultural footprints, and the equitable distribution of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered to be decent civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (of which Congress was the only component) under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to collect taxes, and because there is no national executive branch or judiciary, Congress has to rely on state governments to enforce all laws, and state governments often fail to cooperate.
It also doesn't have the power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles had to be amended by unanimous consent of all the states, and the states treated the central government with such disdain that their state representatives were often absent.
Both the Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the Soccer World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often called "the archipelago" from a geological point of view
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. European sailors who passed by at that time named the island "Ilha Formosa" (Ilha Formosa), which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, began to change the food production methods of the aborigines, and hired Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared Taiwan a province.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the House of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of what the complex originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm, the dominant film size at the end of the film film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio was applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide by 24mm high, so the format is actually a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) for this format is 3:2.
Many common formats, such as the APS family of formats, have the same or a fairly close ratio to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is an easy guide when creating dynamics and keeping images organized.
It states that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely supervised.
Although the languages and customs of different European countries are different, Christianity has linked them together for more than a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, its pervasive power affects everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's monetary fund is set up specifically for this purpose.
The centralized church system existed in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many people to question whether they were living up to this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
They cut off vital military and civilian supplies. The strategy has proven effective, even though such a blockade violates generally accepted international law developed under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain lays mines in international waters, preventing any vessel from entering the entire area, even posing a threat to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the brutality of World War I, nations are eager to avoid a repeat of their mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, accepting a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Different periods in ancient China have their own characteristics; each period in China or each family in charge of the world is a dynasty with distinctive characteristics.
Similarly, the period of successive dynasties was an unstable era in which small countries were divided. The most famous of these is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period, which was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various princes fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest power in Xi'an's luxurious palace.
There were also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from autocracy to republic, nationalism, the belief that the state did not belong to a single ruler but to the people.
Moreover, after the revolution, applications for office were open to all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful a chance to rise to prominence.
The same goes for the military, since rank is no longer based on rank, but on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start revolutions of their own.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than earthly life. He used to go to meditate in a cave called "Silah" on the "Nur" (Bright) Mountain.
The cave itself, not only has survived the test of time, but also provides an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on top of a mountain in the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated from the world.
Nothing to see but the clear beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. In the cave, few sights and sounds from the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramids built to pay homage to the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (or "Giza Pyramid Complex") in Egypt's Death Valley includes multiple pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and multiple smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "bow down" symbol looks like a staple or a square without a base.
Up refers to drawing the bow from the tip, and down refers to drawing the bow from the buttock (where the bow is held).
Upbows generally produce a softer sound, while downbows produce a stronger, firmer sound.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that printed notes have musical meaning, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (Marie Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and the King His sister, Lady Elizabeth, was driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of city women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a crowd surrounded them, yelling and threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages all the way.
At one point, in the face of the terrified queen, a mob waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism in its conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, which covered most of their expenses, as well as interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that prompted the formation of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the events took place is often referred to as the high medieval period of European history, the period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages is preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers many kinds of thought in practice, including technological facilitation, technological necessity, and a strict definition—human destiny is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology of.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two general lines of thought: that the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, has inherent socially unconditioned effects on society. "Influence".
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily facilitated the development of roads.
However, it was not economically feasible to build a national road network for just a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Higher car ownership will also lead to higher rates of road accidents, which will lead to the invention of new medical technologies to repair wounds of the injured.
Romanticism has a strong color of cultural determinism. This stems from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with geography emerge that are better than arbitrary imposed laws because they are in harmony with where society is many.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around AD 400 and continued until around AD 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders returned with gifts of greater value, such as silks and spices, than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries to the 14th century.
At first, skirts were deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, fashion in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind due to slow cultural exchange.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advances at that time was that after the Crusades, people began to use buttons to tie their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that maximizes yields using native seeds conserved within the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence farming. This is still the case today in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards, fostering a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may be distinct based on the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
What makes a subculture unique may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subcultural group often symbolically signal their membership through a distinctive style of conduct, including fashionable clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is by using the case of a small number of unfortunate children. These children grow up without the help of adults in their socialization due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "ye ha", which means wild children. Some feral children were kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children were abandoned because the parents refused to accept that the child was severely handicapped mentally or physically.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others, it is said, were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by a non-human animal, its behavior (to the extent allowed by its physical condition) will be very similar to that animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a means of assisting someone who is just learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be done online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, just like the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is built into the software to question, prompt and explain procedures that might be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is uneducated, uncaring, uneducated, and it backfires.
We think the foster care system is a safe place for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that the family of origin lacks.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet add an extra dimension to what it is used for and how it is fulfilled.
For example, "learning" and "communication" were identified as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to the website, Aimer and McDell (1998) also included "personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" as new motivating factors.
The use of video footage has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions (facial movements lasting milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper "The President's Speeches," Oliver Sacks showed that people who were unable to understand language due to brain damage were still able to accurately judge the sincerity of speakers.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be shared by animals such as the domestic dog.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: dominant and recessive.
Mutation adds new genetic variants, while selection removes variants from the pool of expressed genetic variants.
Mutations move back and forth between the two pools each generation due to segregation and recombination.
In the savannah, primates have a digestive system similar to that of humans, and the existing plant resources are difficult to meet the demand of primates for amino acids.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant-based sources would be the protein in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting this unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a lot of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Taken together, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up without being fully woken up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm while you're sleeping, move the alarm across the room to force yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other circadian-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea—which are known to be diuretic) before bedtime and forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inverse to the level of physical and mental tension.
The less stress there is, the more positively the life force manifests itself. It is possible for everyone to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and the many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tenya Yoga. By visualizing different gods, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, the state of epiphany is achieved.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries in World War II, which promoted the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, institutional, procedural, and cultural clashes drove the two nations apart.
Two years after the war ended, once allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war lasted 40 years, with proxy armies fighting on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been breached, and the only hope left was to retreat and rearrange the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, and more than 800,000 The Red Army entered the country and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the Navy has been to ensure that the nation maintains its ability to transport its personnel and cargo, while at the same time, disrupting the enemy's ability to transport its personnel and cargo.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to help Britain by sending people and supplies across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly U-boats, attempted to intercept the transport.
Had the Allies failed then, Germany might well have conquered Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in Iran's Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eat and use their milk, meat, fur and hide.
Domestic goats are usually herded in groups on hills or other pastoral areas, and they are usually tended by goat herders (mostly children or adolescents), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
Freight lanes were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn railcars were simply made of parallel wooden planks, at the time, these carts allowed the horses to run faster and pull more on slightly rough roads.
Sleepers were introduced very early to fix rails. However, people gradually realized that if iron sheets were placed on the rails, the rails would be more stable and efficient.
This became common practice, but the iron pieces would wear down the wooden wagon wheels even more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was built.
The first known form of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, humans began to walk upright with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors Australopithecus did not have the habit of walking upright.
Biped specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus in Chad may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists, and reduce future disasters to some extent.
In many cases this is very similar to symptomatic therapy. But if we want more than a temporary solution, then we should get to the root of the problem and root it out.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and the problem is made worse by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 before being sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away for printing.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight in what is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and survive to this day, known as "birds".
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They had scales and claws on their feet, laid eggs, and walked on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing binary-encoded information.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary numbers, or "bits" in computer terms.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
Possibly the strongest indicator of poison ingestion are containers containing drugs or household toxic chemicals that have been opened at the scene.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the word "bug" to formally refer to this class of insects.
The term stems from familiarity with bedbugs, an insect well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both stink bugs and bedbugs are nesting insects, adapted to live in the host's nest or dwelling.
With approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in various regions of the United States, the disease has become a major neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS), research has found.
A couple may decide not to have children out of their own interests, or the interests of their children.
These couples may create adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this approach guides most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, however, an experiment is not the only way. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on problems in all scientific fields, including psychology, are accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the circadian and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often depend to a large extent on the existence and existence of endogenous cycles generated by circadian clocks.
Periodic rhythms are not simply responses to external periodic signals. This rhythm is documented in most organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillating devices, continuing free-running cycles for periods of time even without external prompting.
Hershey and Chase's experiments were one of the main evidences for DNA as hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, one was to label the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other was to label the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas and who come to see natural scenery, including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park and studying the ecosystem.
For example, see, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to work, and the people they pass by on the road work in the place where they left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is connected in some way to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Now, science shows that this massive carbon economy can no longer stabilize the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has a complaint about the transportation system.
In the developed world, you will rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of similar magnitude.
Why is the transportation system causing such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency that can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but there are plenty of people who think otherwise; they think the solar system revolves around the earth, and so does the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to 6 miles in some sections.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of the flow of all rivers in the world into the sea.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river's water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and superb construction technology of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
Ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom marveled at the thousand-year-old monuments of their predecessors.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in laws, regulations and official correspondence.
Italian is also the language spoken by most people working in the country on a daily basis, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorized that they transform into new matter that makes up what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals, as are elements such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could fit trillions of them.
Therefore, as soon as the pencil came out, it became a favorite of many people.
Sadly, the pencil fell into obscurity and usage less and less as new ways of writing emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to reach for a pencil sharpener.
One can only speculate as to what will happen to the keyboard when newer offerings emerge.
A fission bomb works like this: It takes energy to hold a nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
Kind of like pushing a bulky little cart up a hill. The nucleus is split again, and some energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split apart with little or no stimulus.
The moon's surface is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust below the dark side is thinner, and the crust below it is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more shadows on the near side, and it is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The core of motivating content theory is to find the factors that make people identify with or generate interest.
These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized as people mature to a certain degree into adulthood.
These theories examine why certain people want to do what they do, and what in their environment makes them do or refrain from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when a manager begins to lead past colleagues, two behaviors emerge. In one case, they will strive to maintain "closeness" with team members.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions and has difficulty enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding accountable.
At the other extreme, the person becomes a very different individual, feeling that he or she has to change everything the team does and keep the results for himself.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of their teams.
This behavior often creates disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are nuances.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take an organization so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity occur when all available resources are used efficiently across the functions of an organization.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome obstacles often leads to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research. Thus, it narrows the scope of the study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and working processes of the brain like never before.
This provides a lot of information and materials for us to build simulation models, which helps us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong sci-fi color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, which studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) involves making machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face capabilities.
All of these become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now routinely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Often, teachers are more than happy to take students to places that buses can't reach.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to review your trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online for scrapbooking.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. While students often start blogging with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers often changes that.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers set out to work on improving their writing and avoiding criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to be more discerning about the world around them". Students are encouraged to be smart and playful in order to satisfy the interest of the audience.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond traditional school lectures.
"Appropriate use of blogs," can make students more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can find their own position in the context of others' writing and be able to present their own views on specific issues ( Oravec, 2002). "
Ottawa, Canada's charming, bilingual capital, is highlighted by a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and north lies the Muskoka River and the untouched natural beauty across the river.
All of this makes Ontario what outsiders think of as Canada.
Farther north the vast lands were sparsely populated, and in some places uninhabited wilderness.
A startling demographic comparison: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar, by far the largest island, is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
The smaller islands are mostly independent countries or owned by France, and they are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, a teaching that prevails in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape shipping route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel region to the north; the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also help (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassing behavior; and it is not uncommon to be followed, arms grabbed, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, say no decisively!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, and the port was once called Anfa ( Anfa).
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Near the old medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as taji pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and various gadgets can be seen everywhere, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. Lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town centre.
While Goma is considered safe, any trip outside Goma should be preceded by research to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has eased.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can explore Goma on a boda-boda (motorbike rental). The normal (local) price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.
And because of its relative remoteness, "Timbaktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign country.
Today, while Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist destination and it has an airport, it's a poor town.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of the desert.
It was an important stop on Henry Louis Gates' "Miracle of the African World" special on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country as it is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions that support different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered a flagship attraction of the South African National Parks System (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, the park has a daily maintenance fee and entrance fee.
There are also many advantages to buying a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some parks or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region, and it is also the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline stand out like a shimmering bar graph against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian interior.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest in India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests aren't just mangrove swamps, though; they also contain remnants of the great jungles that once overgrown the Gangetic plains.
The Sundberns covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is water/marsh area.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. There are currently an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sika deer living in the area.
There are buses throughout the day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most trips, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
In view of the fact that the shuttle bus is often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses are available in most areas.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapoc River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapoc River and connects Oyapoc, Brazil, with Saint-Georges, French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two 3.50 meters wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but traffic did not begin until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They live a semi-nomadic hunting life and also engage in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Indian Province", the product of an encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the city's indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the top polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here.
For tournament news and how to buy polo tickets, check out the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound, which is the British pound equivalent.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted for payment in Stanley.
On the outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currencies are accepted; please check with the host beforehand to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so do so before leaving the island.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can be colder than it looks: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when the wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park managers say: Keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack a human.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured for failing to maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town, on the island of Upolu, has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
A peaceful rally in the town resulted in the murder of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III during a struggle for independence organized by the Mau Mau movement.
Auckland straddles two ports, so there are plenty of beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south on the Pacific Ocean.
It's almost all sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and mostly shaded by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes packed with vacationing families and are lined with shops of all kinds. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It has an uncomplicated taste, but is delicious and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are plenty of French wines to buy here, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better able to travel long distances.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still concerned, bottled water is easily available as well.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively new. Small cups of black coffee are "espresso", cappuccinos are piled high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate was up to Belgian standards. Juices are expensive but of good quality.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and it is rare to get injured while participating in any of the above activities on the Great Barrier Reef.
Still, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found on the beach and near the estuary in 1770 between October and April. Occasionally they can also be spotted at other points in time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is not the ocean, but the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind knowing they'll have somewhere to stay overnight when they arrive at their destination.
While travel agents may help you book other forms of accommodation such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, round-trip airport transfers, and some even offer flight and hotel accommodation packages.
They can hold the booking for you if you need time to consider whether the price is right, or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to get to your destination.
Any amendments or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not with the hotel directly.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to see the show up close, you'll have to get there early and secure a camp close to the stage.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stage may be over, the rest of the festival may be playing music well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If traversing the North Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as sailing on ice can make for very horrendous noises for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visas (see Terms of Service for details).
Casinos generally try to get their guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos often have no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment to keep guests happy and staying at the casino.
Some venues serve alcohol for free. However, drunkenness impairs one's judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, icy conditions or freezing temperatures.
On ice and snow, there's so little friction that you can't drive like you would on smooth asphalt.
During a blizzard, the snowfall can be enough to trap you in a very short amount of time.
Snowfall, drifting snow, dripping or icing on the windows may also block the view.
On the other hand, snow and ice are common in many countries, and traffic is hardly interrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight of many visitors' itineraries.
The term 'safari', in its common usage, refers to an overland journey to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to enjoy being up close to cars, and standard equipment makes for a better appreciation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite scary at times, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Trekking (also called "bush walking", "safari" or "excursion") is primarily walking on foot and usually takes a few hours or lasts several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in for a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellations due to coronavirus had not been extended into July 2020 - when the Olympics were originally scheduled to take place.
Expect ticket prices for most events to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with typical ticket prices around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry out. Even if the room does not have an iron and ironing board, many hotels provide a loan service.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try it with a hair dryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the garment get too hot (this can cause shrinkage and, in extreme cases, burn the garment).
There are many ways to clean water, and some are more effective for certain types of pollution.
In some regions, a minute of poaching is sufficient, in others a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if this is a concern then you should consider purchasing airtight bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are not commonly seen back home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritating reactions and in more severe cases allergic reactions, transmit venom or infectious disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently kill humans, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to buy duty-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a ton of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through many isolated backcountry areas .
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your head up: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns everywhere.
The posted speed limit here is significantly lower than the sections before and after, with a common speed limit of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed limit is more important than other sections .
Oddly enough, though, cell phone service is much stronger here than on many other routes along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Badlands.
German pastries are good, Bavarian pastries are more colorful, very similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit snacks are common, with apples available year-round for snacks and cherries and plums in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with espresso.
If you want a little snack with a strong flavor, you can try the jam bag. This dessert has different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, Krapfen.
A curry meal is a dish based on herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
Curry meals can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of water.
Yogurt is often used in curries in northern India and inland Pakistan, while coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent.
There are 17,000 islands in Indonesia, so Indonesian cuisine is just an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
But without further modifiers, the term tends to refer to foods native to the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese food is eaten all over the archipelago, and there are many dishes with simple seasoning methods. The main seasonings that Javanese people like are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
Stirrups hang from the sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for the rider, but also pose a safety hazard, as the rider's foot can get caught.
If a rider is thrown from his horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him while galloping. To minimize this risk, there are a few precautions you can take.
First, most horse riders wear riding boots with a heel, and the soles are smooth and fairly narrow.
Second, some saddles—especially English-style saddles—were equipped with safety buckles that would allow the stirrup straps to fall from the saddle if a fallen rider pulled back.
Chile's top climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley, has been dubbed South America's Yosemite for its eclectic mix of granite boulders and cliffs.
The view from the mountain is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world continue to forge new routes on its long stretch of cliffs that double as climbing walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes regular skiing and snowboarding, is a very popular sport in which skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and slide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many snowboarders, sometimes called "ski freaks," who plan to spend their entire vacations skiing somewhere.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 1600s, with the Norwegians opening the first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861.
Ski Freestyle: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
This activity is associated with alpine ski touring or mountaineering, although neither is usually practiced. Both activities involve steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of ski trails as analogous hiking trails.
When conditions are good, you can go farther than you can on foot - but only on rare occasions can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing on flat tracks without a heavy pack on your back.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Typically, traveling across multiple countries means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually go straight through the border without having to go through passport control again.
By the same token, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, saving time, money and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which processed items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographic differences in this definition, and places such as North America may have shorter year limits than Europe.
Artifacts may be defined as antiques, even though they are much younger than their mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami. The culture surrounding the industry is also important to many people who make a living in other occupations.
However, not all Sami are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, even in the traditional sense, subsisting from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and often using reindeer as draft animals.
Today many Sami are engaged in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for Sapmi, or the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and false perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is made for their citizens.
For example, US citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
The advice given here tends to be rough, general, and simplistic when compared to the more detailed information presented elsewhere.
Severe weather is an umbrella term for any hazardous weather phenomenon; weather that causes damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can happen anywhere in the world. There are different types of severe weather, depending on geographic location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in their location, which may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment courses" may yield addresses of local companies offering training.
The course typically covers all of the issues discussed here, often in depth with hands-on experience.
Course training usually lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, first aid training and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on survival in war zones are rare.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents when returning.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without gender (X) specified, or to have documents altered to match a desired name and gender.
The level of recognition of these documents by foreign governments also varies widely.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy and have no guarantee of their dignity when they go through the scanner.
A rip current is the rapid backflow of waves from the beach into the sea, usually over a reef or similar.
The submerged topography caused the return flow to concentrate in a few deeper areas, where jet streams to deeper water could form.
Most deaths are the result of exhausted swimming against the current, and swimming against the current is unlikely to be successful.
Swimming back after getting out of the turbulent water is not that difficult.
Try to swim to a place where you won't get trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skill and whether you have been spotted).
The shock of returning home comes faster (shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who adapt easily to a new culture, it can sometimes be difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a period of time, when you come back to your country, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people can be very patient and understanding because they know travelers need to adapt to a new country.
One might not think of it, but travelers also need patience and understanding on the return journey.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most fun things to do in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them there silently before the show starts.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and small vendors here. The interweaving of sound and light is like telling a moving story.
On the background curtain is the Sphinx, which is also the narrator of the long story.
The scene is shown on the pyramids and different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim the archipelago, and the archipelago has the largest number of bases, with sixteen active on the island in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas".
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island. There, a still-active crater is flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-form the 360-kilometre-long Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern, or Sentinel Range, hosts the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Range, with the highest peak being Vinson Peak at 4,892 metres.
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is out of reach, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones, because calls can only be made outdoors where the satellite signal is unblocked.
The service is frequently used in shipping, including yachts, and expeditions with long-range data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide details on connecting to this service.
Study tours are becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning how they will spend their gap year.
This is especially popular among secondary school leavers, who can take a year off before going to university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can substantially improve your chances of returning to your home country.
Typically, tuition fees are required to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent sailing mecca, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", with thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Among the archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not required.
The coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, though smaller boats and even kayaks make a difference.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have similar situations, but are otherwise unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one in forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises include an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that there are several full days to visit the historic city and return to the ship for the night to sleep.
A separate visa is not required if you are only going ashore on a cruise (regulation as of 2009).
Some cruise lines feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and the cruise price does not include a tour of the city.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if you've never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's the same fear and loathing many people have about anything else.
For some, it may be helpful to understand how an airplane works and the procedures for flying it if they are to overcome fear of the unknown or situations beyond their control.
Courier companies can get paid well for delivering goods quickly. Many times, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they use air to transport the goods, on some routes, it may take several days to unload and clear customs.
The fastest way is to carry it as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, it is forbidden to carry the luggage of passengers who have not boarded the plane, and you need to be present at this time.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a fortune for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay you to fly).
However, it doesn't come cheap: as a rough estimate, a ticket in business class can cost four times as much as regular economy, and first class can cost 11 times more!
Generally speaking, there is no need to look for discounted business-class or first-class tickets when flying non-stop from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there are core passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-styled Transnistrian republic in eastern Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any of the United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million. It is the second largest port in Turkey after Istanbul and it is also a busy transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center surrounded by a huge bay and mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets and ancient mosques and churches are scattered among the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls, but the city is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish European atmosphere.
The village of Haldarsvík offers great views of the nearby island of Eysturoy. There is a distinctive octagonal church in the village.
In the churchyard there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some of the graves.
It's well worth the half hour stroll through this charming village.
Head north with easy access to the romantic and charming town of Sintra; it is Lord Byron's celebrated paradise and is therefore well known to foreigners.
The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also head north to visit the Notre-Dame de Fatima (Sacred Site), the world-famous site of apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Remember, you are actually visiting the site of a massive mass grave that has invaluable significance to a large group of people around the world.
There are still many men and women who survived here, and they are still alive today; and many more relatives, some were massacred there, and some were toiled to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please give this place the dignity, dignity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not mark or graffiti on buildings as this could damage the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, which is understood by the vast majority, and Spanish, which is understood by almost everyone.
However, most signage is in Catalan only, as this is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but an automated system makes occasional announcements in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are notoriously self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to try to behave yourself and act like a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This will make it much easier to participate in social activities.
Parisian rudeness will disappear in no time if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, dominated by beech, spruce and fir, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is famous for its rich flora, thanks to the diversity of microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The area is also home to a variety of animals and birds.
Rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, feral cats and grouse can be seen there as well as many more common species
Women are required to wear skirts when visiting monasteries, which must reach to the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide wraps for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, the monks at the door will give you a grin.
Likewise, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
It is also possible to borrow from the locker at the entrance, but clothes are not laundered every time someone wears them, so the dresses can be a bit uncomfortable to wear. All are one size fits all!
Cuisine in Mallorca, like its Mediterranean counterparts, is largely based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses exclusively olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner, especially popular in summer: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever toppings you have on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns except "Sie," which refers to you, should begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from objects.
This can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing somewhat, since you need to judge whether a verb or an adjective is being used as a form of nominalization.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy as most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation changes according to the following vowels.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: "caro" means "dear," and "carro" means "chariot."
Persian grammar is mostly relatively simple and has rules to follow.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer can help you master more Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that learning Portuguese is easier if you speak a Romance language.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might rush to the conclusion that Portuguese is so close to Spanish that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete, remaining as museums or educational spaces.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not as severe as it is today, observatories were often built in urban areas or on campuses, which were more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern scientific research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "hanami", has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, where plum blossom is a kind of flower that Chinese people love to see.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other aristocratic members of the imperial family in the Imperial Palace.
Plants are at their best in their natural environment. So resist the temptation to remove even "just one" plant.
If you are visiting a well-arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also be expelled, and there is no room for negotiation.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place and easy to navigate. You can buy almost anything when you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both high temperatures (year-round) and intense sunshine (relatively rare when the weather is clear).
Several buses also headed north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you plan to take will go into Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to visit the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide directions for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, which was established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday are also embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of waking up somewhere outside on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its Christian theological interpretation, but it is likely to be a ritual to celebrate spring and pray for a good harvest that existed before the birth of Christ.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations usually pouring in to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
Initially, animals reached these islands by swimming, flying or floating.
Because it is far away from the mainland, mammals cannot travel long distances, making giant tortoises the main herbivores of the Coron Islands.
When humans came to the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience polar night, a period of time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights as the sky will be more or less dark all day long.
These areas are sparsely populated, generally there is no problem of light pollution, and you can also enjoy the bright starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the work culture that Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues refer to each other by each other's last names or job titles.
Harmonious workplace atmosphere is crucial, emphasizing team efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain the approval of their superiors when making any decisions, and need to obey the instructions of their superiors unconditionally.
