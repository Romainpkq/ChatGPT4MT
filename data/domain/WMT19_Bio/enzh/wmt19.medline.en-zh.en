The Heart-Healthy Lenoir Project is a multi-study project designed to reduce the risk burden of heart disease in Lenoir County, North Carolina.
This case report examines one client's experience in this project and the impact of health coaching interventions that were used.
The client presented with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and a systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 200 mmHg.
After 1 year of educational group meetings and personalized health coaching, the client was able to reduce her BP to an acceptable range and has adopted many new lifestyle behaviors.
This case report demonstrates one way health coaching is being integrated into educational programs and in collaboration with primary care practices.
Integrative health coaching (IHC) offers significant health improvement in biometric measures without pharmaceuticals.
In this case of newly diagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with obesity, IHC used the patient's strengths to reverse IGT, prevent frank diabetes, and reduce weight by 40 lbs or 21% of her original weight.
This intervention included a client self-assessment and 14 in-person health coaching sessions over 11 months.
IHC provides a framework to accomplish short-term goals and identify and overcome barriers while drawing on the strengths and aims of the individual.
An 18-year old female was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with an initial episode of mania.
Treated with routine dosages of lithium bicarbonate, her symptoms resolved after two weeks; she was discharged on a dosage of 250mg lithium bid.
Five days after discharge she was taken to the emergency department of a general hospital with loss of appetite and disturbed consciousness.
The general hospital physicians were unable to diagnose the problem so she was transferred back to the psychiatric hospital.
At that time she had a lithium blood level of 0.57 mmol/L (i.e., at the lower end of the therapeutic range) but was, nevertheless, clearly experiencing lithium intoxication with anuria, trembling extremities, blurred speech, muscle rigidity and hyperactive tendon reflexes.
Treated with intravenous mannitol, her acute symptoms resolved quickly.
The case highlights the need to monitor clinical symptoms of intoxication in all patients taking lithium, regardless of their blood level, and to inform patients, family members, and general physicians about the symptoms and management of lithium intoxication.
METHODS A total of 25 C57/129 adult mice were randomly divided into the normal control group (0 h) and the groups at 1, 6, 12 or 24 after severe burns (n=5 per group).
A model with third degree (20% of the total body surface area) burn injury was established and then liver tissues were taken.
IFIT1 expression was examined by Western blot. The expression of caspase-3 and -8 was measured by immunohistochemistry. Liver cell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL).
The increase in IFIT1 expression after severe burns promotes liver cell apoptosis.
Approximately half a million people are thought to develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis annually.
Barely 20% of these people currently receive recommended treatment and only about 10% are successfully treated.
Poor access to treatment is probably driving the current epidemic, via ongoing transmission.
Treatment scale-up is hampered by current treatment regimens, which are lengthy, expensive, poorly tolerated and difficult to administer in the settings where most patients reside.
Although new drugs provide an opportunity to improve treatment regimens, current and planned clinical trials hold little promise for developing regimens that will facilitate prompt treatment scale-up.
In this article we argue that clinical trials, while necessary, should be complemented by timely, large-scale, operational research that will provide programmatic data on the use of new drugs and regimens while simultaneously improving access to life-saving treatment.
Perceived risks - such as the rapid development of resistance to new drugs - need to be balanced against the high levels of mortality and transmission that will otherwise persist.
Doubling access to treatment and increasing treatment success could save approximately a million lives over the next decade.
METHODS The expressions of Twist1 in 32 cervical cancers and matched normal tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell invasive ability and the expression of invasion-related genes were determined in RNAi-based Twist1-silencing HeLa cells. The relationship between Twist1 and microRNA-33a (miR-33a) in cervical cancer was studied by Pearson correlation analysis, and the roles of miR-33a in regulation of Twist1 and cell invasiveness were studied.
RESULTS The positive expression rate of Twist1 was 75.0% (24/32) and 21.9% (7/32) in the cervical cancer and the matched normal tissues, respectively, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). Twist1 shRNA significantly decreased the invasiveness of HeLa cells (P<0.05).
Compared with the matched normal tissues, the expression of miR-33a was increased in the cervical cancer tissues, which was negatively correlated with Twist1 (r=-0.661, P<0.05). Overexpression of miR-33a could significantly suppress Twist1 expression as well as cell invasiveness (P<0.05).
This study aims to explore the effect and molecular mechanism of the invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells after knock-down of CK2α expression.
METHODS The pSilencerTM 4.1-siCK2α-eGFP of lentiviral-mediated shRNA was constructed. The expression of CK2α was knock-downed, and a stable A549 cell line was established.
The invasion and migration of A549 cell line was detected through Transwell and Boyden chamber assays.
The protein expression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (EMT) was evaluated using Western blot analysis.
RESULTS The invasion and migration of A549 cells were significantly inhibited after the knockdown of CK2α expression compared with that in the control group. p-PTEN, Akt, p-Akt473, p-Akt308, p-PDK1, p-c-Raf, and p-GSK-3β were significantly downregulated, whereas PTEN was upregulated.
In the literature examining neighbourhood effects on educational outcomes, the socialisation mechanism is usually investigated by looking at the association between neighbourhood characteristics and educational attainment.
We attempt to fill this gap by looking at how the internalisation of educational norms (commitments) is influenced by neighbourhoods' immigrant concentration.
We investigate this process for both migrant and native youth, as both groups might be influenced differently by immigrant concentrations.
To test our hypothesis we used longitudinal panel data with five waves (N = 4255), combined with between-within models which control for a large portion of potential selection bias.
These models have an advantage over naïve OLS models in that they predict the effect of change in neighbourhood characteristics on change in educational commitment, and therefore offer a more dynamic approach to modelling neighbourhood effects.
Our results show that living in neighbourhoods with higher proportions of immigrants increases the educational commitments of migrant youth compared to living in neighbourhoods with lower proportions.
Besides, we find that adolescents with a resilient personality experience less influence of the neighbourhood context on educational commitments than do adolescents with non-resilient personalities.
Methods: A total of 32 C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: a sham group, an AMI group, a low-dose atorvastatin [2 mg/(kg.d)] group and a high-dose atorvastatin [20 mg/(kg.d)] group.
In addition, mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro were differentiated and they were stimulated by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). The protein expressions of adiponectin and resistin in adipocytes were detected. The effects of atorvastatin on ox-LDL-induced adipokine imbalance in adipocytes were identified.
Results: The plasma levels of hs-CRP and resistin in AMI mice were significantly increased, whereas the plasma levels of adiponectin were remarkably decreased.
The plasma levels of hs-CRP were positively correlated with resistin but negatively with adiponectin.
In vitro study, ox-LDL increased resistin protein and adiponectin expressions in adipocytes, which were dose-dependently reversed by atorvastatin.
Conclusion: Inflammation activation in AMI mice leads to adipokine imbalance. Atorvastatin ameliorates the AMI-induced adipokine imbalance via anti-inflammation.
Total parathyroidectomy (PTX) can be used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in uremic patients, relieving the patient's osteolytic destruction.
Complete resection of bilateral parathyroid glands is key to successful operation.
The biological effects mediated by vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) are involved in the regulation of multiple pathophysiologic processes, including calcium phosphorus metabolism, immune regulation, anti-inflammation, anti-infection and cancer prevention, etc. Autophagy is a eukaryotic cell lysosome-mediated catabolic pathway, which is classified into 3 different types: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy.
Since autophagy is vital to maintain energy and metabolism in cells, autophagy dysfunction is closely associated with various pathological processes such as inflammation, infection and tumor.
Studies have shown that vitamin D/VDR can affect the different stages of autophagy and regulate inflammation in autophagy. Moreover, vitamin D/VDR and autophagy play an important role in autoimmune disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other inflammatory diseases.
To examine the changes of mimecan protein expression in development of atherosclerosis induced by sinoaortic denervation, and to explore the effects of mimecan knock down on the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.
Methods: The animals were randomly divided into a sham group and a model group (n=8 in each group).
The rat model of blood pressure variability was established by sinoaortic denervation, and the hemodynamic indexes were recorded 20 weeks after the surgery to confirm the success of the model.
The thoracic aorta was excised and stained with immunohistochemistry to observe the pathological changes of smooth muscle tissues and the changes of mimecan expression.
Results: Twenty weeks after sinoaortic denervation, the blood pressure variability in the model group was significantly increased compared with that in the sham group, suggesting the model was successfully established.
In addition, the increased blood pressure variability in the model group promoted the proliferation and migration of the vascular smooth muscle cells in thoracic aorta, while the expression of mimecan protein was significantly decreased.
In in vitro assays, the knock down of mimecan in mice vascular smooth muscle cells could promote the cell proliferation and migration.
Results: Stunting, underweighting and wasting represented the poor nutritional conditions, which accounted for 28.6%, 25.3% and 25.3%, respectively.
Maternal accurate perception and the psychological problems such as anxiety and depression were the main relevant factors.
Conclusion: The poor nutritional condition for the congenital heart disease was serious. It is very important to improve the maternal accurate perception and to relieve the maternal psychological problems for changing the nutritional condition through appropriate health education and effective intervention.
Laryngotracheal stenosis includes congenital laryngotracheal stenosis and secondary laryngotracheal stenosis.
Congenital laryngotracheal anomalies are rare, accounting for 0.3%-1.0% of all laryngotracheal stenosis(LTS).
Despite the management of pediatric LTS over the past 30 years had been considerable improved, primary surgery still failed in a significant number of complex LTS cases. In some severe LTS cases combined with glottic stenosis, the primary surgery failed around 30%, even with the latest available techniques.
Children with LTS usually need multiple operations, and need the tracheostomy tube for months or even years.
Objective To investigate the polymorphisms of 23 Y-STR loci in a Han population in Jiangsu province.
Methods Blood samples were collected from 4821 unrelated healthy Han males in Jiangsu province. DNA templates were amplified by PowerPlex Y23 kit,and the amplification products were detected by 3500xL genetic analyzer. Then,we calculated the allele frequencies and gene diversities respectively,as well as the haplotype frequencies and haplotype diversities.
Results The gene diversity of these 23 Y-STR loci ranged 0.4099-0.9696.
A total of 4781 haplotypes were detected,of which 4743 were found once. The haplotype diversity was 0.99999812.
Conclusion The 23 Y-STR loci used in this study are highly polymorphic in Han individuals in Jiangsu province and therefore suitable for population genetic study and forensic individual identification.
Along with the increase in the prevalence of lipid metabolism disorders,in vitro research on the adipocytes has been a hot topic in recent years.
3T3-L1 preadipocyte line is one of the most commonly used cell line for establishing adipocytes models. However,for 3T3-L1 cell lines,the traditional method,known also as the "Cocktail" method,have disadvantages including low transformation rate and heterogeneous conversion.
Therefore,many studies aimed to improving the induction method by changing the time of inducers or adding other new drugs have been performed(known as the improved method).
The present study was to summarize the progress of the traditional methods and the improved methods for inducing 3T3-L1 cell lines to mature adipocytes.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, distressing and substantially impairing neuropsychiatric disorder, characterized by obsessions or compulsions.
The current case describes a 44-year-old adult female diagnosed with OCD.
The patient had an incomplete response to several SSRIs alone during her past treatment, and led a poor-quality life for at least three years.
Current multidimensional approaches, including combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI, Sertraline) with a small dose of antipsychotics (Aripiprazole) for augmentation, as well as familial support and resources from the internet were provided for the patient for six months.
Standardized assessments with Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) every two months indicated significant reductions in obsessive and compulsive symptoms, with significant improvements in her social functioning and quality of life.
A case such as this one provides preliminary support to multidimensional approaches for OCD treatment in order to achieve an optimal response, though further rigorous clinical trials are needed to provide more evidence.
Fungal polyketides display complex structures and variously biological activities. Their biosynthetic pathways generally contain novel enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
This review provides a summary of recent research advances in molecular mechanism of the biosynthesis of fungal polyketides including highly-reducing polyketide synthases (HR-PKSs), non-reducing polyketide synthases (NR-PKSs), as well as polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthase (PKS-NRPSs) and reducingnon- reducing polyketide synthase (HR-NR PKSs) hybrids.
The elucidation of biosynthetic mechanism of many fungal polyketides provides guidance on the discovery of new biosynthetic gene cluster of fungal polyketide natural products and compounds with novel structures as well as their analogue.
Exponential growth of the mass spectrometry (MS) data is exhibited when the mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been developing rapidly.
It is a great challenge to develop some quick, accurate and repeatable methods to identify peptides and proteins.
Nowadays, the spectral library searching has become a mature strategy for tandem mass spectra based proteins identification in proteomics, which searches the experiment spectra against a collection of confidently identified MS/MS spectra that have been observed previously, and fully utilizes the abundance in the spectrum, peaks from non-canonical fragment ions, and other features.
This review provides an overview of the implement of spectral library search strategy, and two key steps, spectral library construction and spectral library searching comprehensively, and discusses the progress and challenge of the library search strategy.
Psychogenic dystonia is one of the most common problems encountered in movement disorder patients and accounted mostly for misdiagnosis, management confusion and treatment resistance.
Psychiatric morbidities often are the culprit, hence proper psychiatric history taking is of utmost importance.
Here we report one case where dystonia was the main presenting complaint of an underlying depressive episode and discuss how managing the cause alleviated the symptoms.
Psychogenic seizures are often underdiagnosed and epilepsy is very often over-treated which leads to multiple financial, social and stigma related difficulties.
The myoclonic seizure itself is a rare phenomenon and when functional movement disorder presents like myoclonus then it's extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.
Here, we are presenting a case who was misdiagnosed as having a myoclonic seizure disorder and treated in multiple places without any improvement which ultimately turned out to be functional movement disorder of a rare variety.
CAR-T cell therapy that targets surface antigens to kill tumor cells specifically has recently become another cornerstone in tumor immunotherapy.
In this study, a lentiviral expression plasmid of CAR targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was constructed by genetic engineering. The recombinant plasmid was co-transfected with other packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation to generate lenti-car, which are CAR lentiviral particles. HER2-specific CAR-T cells were obtained by transducing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with lenti-car. Their specific inhibitory effects on HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumor cells were analyzed in vitro.
Thus, the constructed second-generation HER2-specific CAR-T cells specifically suppressed growth of tumor cells overexpressing HER2 protein, suggesting that HER2-specific CAR-T cells might prove useful for immunotherapy of HER2-positive cancer.
Reaching the level of herd protection by increasing vaccine coverage is the basic strategy to eradicate related infectious diseases.
Again, herd protection has played an important role in public health practices.
With the increasing interests in estimating the vaccine herd protection, we however, have seen only few relevant papers including observational population-based and cluster-randomized clinical trials reported in China.
Peritoneal metastasis is the second leading cause of death of colorectal cancer patients.
Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermia intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the primary method to treat peritoneal metastasis of colorectal cancer, though there remain some controversies.
We reviewed current studies of colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and CRS+ HIPEC, and discussed some issues with regard to the scoring system for peritoneal metastasis, selection criteria for CRS+ HIPEC treatment, and the new drug application for colorectal PC.
Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) is the most useful scoring system for peritoneal metastasis and CRS+ HIPEC is the primary treatment for colorectal PC.
Patients with PCI<20 should receive thorough assessment on the feasibility of R0 or R1 resection and CRS+ HIPEC treatment. For patients with unresectable PC at the initial stage, active drug therapy should be adopted to achieve tumor regression, so that some of them would have the opportunity to receive CRS+ HIPEC treatment.
As a common disease in orthopedics, osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) frequently occurs among young and middle-aged people.
Hip joint preserving surgery has attracted more and more attention due to the fact that artificial joint prosthesis has a certain useful life and the rate of hip joint revision is high and the higher risk of many complications.
There are a large number of operative methods for preserving hip joint in clinical practice without definitive effectiveness.
How to choose appropriate surgical methods at the right time is also a continuous understanding. The pathological process of necrosis of the femur helps to choose the choice of the femoral head necrosis for the treatment of hip operation.
Core decompression and impaction bone grafting with simple operative methods can relieve internal pressure of femoral head and pain symptoms, but they cannot remove necrotic bone completely. Hence, they are only used for ONFH in the early stage.
Vascularized bone transplantation can fill defects of the former, as it can not only completely remove necrotic bone, but also provide bone graft with nourishing vessels for femoral head, being beneficial to reconstruct the bone structure of femoral head.
Subsequently, the application of tantalum rod can provide mechanical support for femoral head to prevent the collapse of femoral head.
Hip joint preserving surgery, in recent years, has been performed increasingly, and has obtained improvement in clinical effects. The multiple combination of a variety of its operative methods provides more effective treatments for ONFH.
It is an essential notion that hip joint preserving surgery, however with any operative method, should as far as possible select a surgical plan with little trauma, simple methods, and little injury of hip joint bone structure based on ensuring the effectiveness.
Vascularize bone graft is one of the most popular technique in current clinical practice of mandibular reconstruction. Fibula is the most common donor site for mandibular reconstruction. The disadvantage of low height of neo-mandible reconstructed by single fibular segment can be solved by vascularized double barrel fibula graft.
Using virtual surgical planning and intraoperative navigation for mandibular reconstruction leads to simplify surgical procedure, reduce operating time and injury, and decrease donor site morbidity so that accurate mandibular reconstruction could be completed. Direction of minimal invasive surgery for mandibular reconstruction will be developed by intraoral approach and intraoral anastomosis.
Methods: From January 2011 to January 2016, a total of 82 patients were diagnosed as large LST without deep submucosal invasion (T1 SM2, ≥1 000 µm) in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Among them, 52 patients were treated by ESD and the other 30 patients were treated by RS [laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC)/open colectomy (OC)].
The clinic data were retrospectively analyzed and the en-bloc resection rate, en-bloc R0 resection rate, local recurrence, complication, procedure time and hospital stay were collected and analyzed.
Results: The lesion sizes were (5.80±1.20) cm and (5.53±0.69) cm in diameter for ESD and RS groups, respectively (P>0.05).
En-bloc resection rates, en-bloc R0 resection rates and recurrence rates showed no significant difference between the ESD group and RS group (P>0.05).
Complication rate of the ESD group (7.69%, 4/52) was much lower than that in the RS group (33.33%, 10/30; P<0.01).
The ESD group also had a shorter hospital stay and operation time than the RS group (P<0.05).
Conclusion: ESD appears to be a safe, minimal invasive and effective strategy for treating large LST and it is obviously better than RS in the aspects of hospital stay, operation time and short-term complication.
To investigate the influential factors for depression and anxiety in patients with chronic wounds, and the relationship between depression and anxiety and social support or quality of life.
Methods: We used convenience sampling method to enroll 150 patients with chronic wounds. Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to assess the level of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and social support in patients with chronic wounds.
Results: The detection rate of depression and anxiety in patients with chronic wounds was 45.3% and 14% respectively.
In patients with chronic wounds, age was positively correlated with SDS and SAS scores (P<0.05), while education, eight factors of SF-36, objective support, subjective support, and social support scores of SSRS were negatively correlated with SDS and SAS scores (P<0.05).
Further multiple regression analysis showed that the duration of wounds, physical functional score, role physical score and role emotional score of SF-36, objective support score, subjective support score, support utilization score, and social support score of SSRS were the independent influential factors for SDS score (P<0.05). Education, general health score, social functional score, and mental health score of SSRS were the independent factors for SAS score (P<0.05).
Conclusion: The lower quality of life and social support of patients with chronic wounds could increase their depression and anxiety.
While treating patients with chronic wounds, medical staff should also pay attention to the mutual influence between anxiety and depression, or quality of life and social support.
Distal stent graft-induced new entry (dSINE) is the complication with high incidence following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for Stanford type B aortic dissection.
Aortic remolding play an important role in prophylaxis of dSINE.
As a major factor in determining performances of the electrochemical super capacitor, electrode materials have received wide attentions recently.
Bacteria, with their advantages of low cost, abundance, environmental protection and easy to get from nature, have become the promising biomaterials.
The composite electrode materials based on bacteria or their related products, have the advantages of large specific surface area, good cycle stability and high capacitance, and become the research focus in the field of super capacitor electrode materials.
The use of various biomimetic methods to achieve remineralization of demineralized dentin and the formation of an organic matrix-inorganic mineral complex with a certain mechanical strength has been a research hotspot in recent years in the field of stomatology, and it also provides a new idea for the restoration of dentin defect.
This review summarizes the process of remineralization of decalcified dentin regulated by non-collagenous protein analogues in vitro.
Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from infection.
Currently, China has licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), including split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine.
Except for a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a category Ⅱ vaccine, which means influenza vaccination is voluntary, and recipients must pay for it.
To strengthen the technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and operational research on influenza vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccine Technical Working Group (TWG), updated the 2014 technical guidelines and compiled the "Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2018-2019)" .
The main updates in this version include: epidemiology, disease burden, types of influenza vaccines, northern hemisphere influenza vaccination composition for the 2018-2019 season, IIV3 and IIV4 immune response, durability of immunity, immunogenicity, vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit. The influenza vaccine TWG provided the recommendations for influenza vaccination for the 2018-2019 influenza season based on existing scientific evidence.
The recommendations described in this report include the following: Points of Vaccination clinics (PoVs) should provide influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications.
No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available.
To decrease the risk of severe infections and complications due to influenza virus infection among high risk groups, the recommendations prioritize seasonal influenza vaccination for children aged 6-59 months, adults ≥60 years of age, persons with specific chronic diseases, healthcare workers, the family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season.
Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection. If they were vaccinated in 2017-2018 influenza season or a prior season, 1 dose is recommended.
People more than 8 years old require 1 dose of influenza vaccine.
It is recommended that people receive their influenza vaccination by the end of October. Influenza vaccination should be offered as soon as the vaccination is available. For the people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccination will continue to be offered for the whole season.
Influenza vaccine is also recommended for use in pregnant women during any trimester.
These guidelines are intended for use by staff members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at all levels who work on influenza control and prevention, PoVs staff members, healthcare workers from the departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases, and staff members of maternity and child care institutions at all levels.
Chinese companies made "artificial plasma" by learning the experience of artificial nutritional medicine at western drugs companies.
A lot advertising presented typical models for modern medicines.
The producers tried to convince the customers of artificial plasma's functions by utilizing famous person advertising effect and the customers' assured talking about it. And the theories of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines experiments were hired to note the functions "artificial plasma" , but it is very difficult to evaluate its real functions.
"Artificial plasma" was fashionable on the market, because the customers joyfully have requirements of nourishing live psychologically, fear being "sick man of Asia" and hopefully strengthen the race and country.
After the Revolution of 1911, the companies wanted to meet not only the need and requirement of the ruler class, but also of the common people.
From later Qing Dynasty, health care and preventive medicine became more popular. Artificial nutritional medicine played an important role in this process.
PiCCO has been used more and more in burn patients in recent years, however there is no clinic consensus on how to apply PiCCO monitoring, understand the significance of PiCCO monitored parameters, and guide the treatment using PiCCO monitored parameters in patients with severe burns.
Based on the current literatures and the experts' clinical experience, national experts consensus on application of pulse contour cardiac output monitoring technique in severe burn treatment (2018 version) is now issued by the Burn and Trauma Branch of Chinese Geriatrics Society, aiming to provide practical guidance for its usage in clinic.
Collagen, as the main structural protein in human body, plays an important role in the wound healing process.
Due to their inherent hemostatic characteristics, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, as well as controllable biodegradability, collagen-based materials have attracted much attention.
In this article, we mainly introduce the characteristics of collagen-based wound biomaterials and the application mechanism as scaffold and wound dressing. And the standard and unified experts' consensus formed on the clinical indications, recommended applications, contraindications, and matters needing attention. The consensus wound help clinicians and patients to recognize collagen-based wound biomaterials correctly and use them rationally.
The prevalence of carbapenems-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP ) in burn wards has become one of the most troublesome issues in current management of bacterial infections.
It is necessary for us to reconsider the epidemiology, risk factors and clinical characteristics of CRKP infection as well as therapeutic options.
Formulating the principles of antimicrobial therapy of CRKP infection and combined antibiotics therapy and implementing appropriate dosage regimens designed by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will be of importance.
Common antimicrobial agents for the treatment of CRKP infection include polymyxins, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and carbapenems.
Infection control measures such as contact isolation, active screening, and environmental surface disinfection must be integrated with antimicrobial stewardship to effectively curb and prevent the spread of CRKP.
The goal of this study is to determine the regions in the spinal cord controlling different hindlimb movements in the rats. Normalization was used for the regions dominating the corresponding movements. It has been verified that FES can be used in motor function recovery of the hindlimb.
The spinal cord was stimulated by FES with a three-dimensional scan mode in experiments.
The results show that stimulation through the electrodes implanted in the ventral locations of the lumbosacral enlargement can produce coordinated single- and multi-joint hindlimb movements. A variety of different hindlimb movements can be induced with the appropriate stimulation sites, and movement vectors of the hindlimb cover the full range of movement directions in the sagittal plane of the hindlimb.
This article drew a map about spinal cord motor function of the rat. The regions in the spinal cord which control corresponding movements are normalized. The data in the study provide guidance about the location of electrode tips in the follow-up experiments.
The 2018 Academic Annual Meeting of the Chinese Burn Association, sponsored by the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Burn Association, was successfully held in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, from October 24th to 27th.
The theme of this conference is " One China, One Standard".
A total of 1, 798 submissions were received, and 1, 060 registered representatives, more than 2, 000 representatives from 9 countries and regions attended the meeting.
The tumor components of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are composed of immune microenvironment of extracellular matrix, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells together with a minority of malignant cells.
The failure of the therapeutic measures, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, has been linked to the specific immune microenvironment of pancreatic cancer.
New efforts in single-cell profiling will enable a better understanding of the composition of the microenvironment in primary and metastatic PDAC, as well as an understanding of how the microenvironment may respond to novel therapeutic approaches.
With the progress of technology, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has become more and more widely used in stomatology.
3D printed template has played an irreplaceable role in oral implantation; at the same time, 3D printed template, which has been successfully applied to the calcified root canal negotiation, endodontic treatment of dental invaginatus, apical surgery and autotransplantation, has also provided a new concept and treatment mode for the diagnosis and therapy of endodontic diseases.
This review, summarized the research and application of 3D printed template from the perspective of the treatment of endodontic deseases.
Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis with no effective treatment.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a regulator for energy metabolism in cells and plays a key role in the energy balance.
Recent studies have shown that AMPK exerted a protective effect on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, which was related to the regulation of inflammation, endothelial cells injury, energy metabolism, myocardial cells apoptosis and autophagy.
Therefore, AMPK is a therapeutic target for sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Our study aimed to amplify and explain the items of statistical reporting requirements proposed by medical journals, and to improve the statistical reporting quality of medical articles.
Statistical reporting requirements were obtained from the reporting standards published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) network, and the editorial board of Chinese Medical Journal, etc. The items involved in statistical reporting requirements were summarized as issues of study design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results. Each item was amplified based on cases of original articles.
It is noticeable that the statistical reporting requirements of English medical journals generally referring to guidance documents, including "Recommendations for the conduct, reporting, editing, and publication of scholarly work in medical journals" proposed by the ICMJE, or the statements for different study types published by the EQUATOR network, where the statistical reporting of medical articles had been detailed specified. The statistical reporting requirements of Chinese medical journals, however, were usually stated by the editorial boards. Although the formats and contents of statistical analysis had been regulated, the requirements of Chinese medical journals were to some extent insufficient and should be enhanced in accordance with the international standards.
In conclusion, the amplification and explanation of statistical reporting requirements were expected to help investigators understand the requirements for statistical reporting in medical researches, so as to effectively improve the quality of medical articles.
The history of vascular surgery in new China could be divided into the following three stages: the first stage, since the early 1980s, the technique of endovascular surgery was introduced in China, developed in some major hospitals, and gradually popularized to some basic hospitals conditionally. Vascular surgery had gradually developed into an independent discipline in China by the late 1980s.
The second stage, since the late 1980s, vascular diagnosis and treatment technology, vascular equipment, and related research modification had been improving continuously in China, and achieved certain success, especially since the establishment of the department of vascular surgery affiliated to the Chinese Medical Association in 1993, vascular surgery in China representing its period of primary development.
The third stage, since the beginning of the 21st century, the innovation of the technique of endovascular surgery and hybridization technology, and the development of materials technology had contributed to the second leaping forward of vascular surgery in China. Since then, vascular surgery enters a new era of minimally invasive surgery and opens a period of rapid development.
Severe frostbite (grade Ⅲ to Ⅳ) is a common disease accompanied with high disability rate in cold regions, especially for military training and disaster events in cold regions.
The treatment of severe frostbite mainly includes rapid rewarming in the early stage and amputation in the later stage; while the damage of vascular endothelial cells, microvascular thrombosis, and decreased tissue perfusion secondary to severe frostbite are important factors affecting prognosis.
Transcatheter arterial thrombolysis is a new technique for the treatment of severe frostbite. It has the advantages of minimally invasive, high safety, and significantly reduced amputation rate. We reviewed the advances in the research of transcatheter arterial thrombolysis for the treatment of severe frostbite.
Cancer is a major disease threatening the people's health in China. Cancer registry is the ground work of the development and evaluation of cancer prevention and control policies.
Cancer registry in China started in 1950s. During the last 60 years, a nationwide cancer surveillance and follow-up network has been developed. All cancer registries covered about 31.51% population of the national population in 2017.
However, there are still some problems in the present work in the aspects of the number and distribution of cancer registries, the depth and width of registry data, the timeliness and accessibility of registry data.
The advent of the big data and informatization era provides a clear direction for the future of cancer registry.
In the next decade, standardizing cancer registry workflow, constructing cancer big data, improving data sharing mechanism and realizing real-time reporting, dynamic monitoring and multi-dimensional presenting of cancer registry data using latest information technologies will be the core methods to solve the problems we are facing now.
Autoimmune liver disease is a group of hepatobiliary injuries mediated by abnormal immunity. It mainly includes autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Recently, an advancement of diagnostic technology has improved the detection and treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.
However, it is easy to be confused with other liver diseases. Thus, the standardization of diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune liver diseases has become a main concern.
Moreover, new progress has been made in basic research and clinical treatment of autoimmune liver diseases since 2018.
Artificial intelligence clinical decision-support system is an important direction of artificial intelligence in the medical field. Both international and domestic researchers are exploring the application value of intelligent decision-making system in the field of cancer.
But at the same time of the craze, there are still some problems in the intelligent decision-making system.
Combining the work of the research groups in this field, this paper explores the current confusions and solutions, and hopes to help clinicians better understand intelligent decision-making.
It is believed that with the deepening of the concept and the advancement of technology, intelligent decision-making will become a good help for doctors in the future.
Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 is widely used in industrial cellulase production, and development of cellulase hyper-producer is of great importance for economic lignocellulosic biorefinery.
In this study, T. reesei Rut-C30 was engineered with an artificial zinc finger proteins (AZFPs) library. Two mutants T. reesei M1 and M2 with improved cellulase production were obtained. Compared to the parent strain, the filter paper activity (FPase) of T. reesei M1 and M2 increased 100% and 53%, respectively. In addition, the total amount of extracellular protein from the M1 mutant increased 69%, whereas the endo-β-glucanase (CMCase) activity of the M2 mutant is 64% higher compared to the parental strain.
Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis showed that the major cellulase genes exhibited significantly increased expression in both mutants, but different patterns were observed in the two mutants.
On the other hand, the cellulase transcriptional repressor ace1 was down-regulated in both mutants, but the transcription level of the activator xyr1 was only up-regulated in the strain M1.
These results demonstrated that different AZFPs exert diverse regulatory mechanisms on cellulase production in T. reesei.
Analysis of the target genes of AZFPs from T. reesei M1 and M2 will not only benefit further exploration of the regulatory mechanisms of cellulase biosynthesis in T. reesei, but also enable development of cellulase hyper-producing strains by metabolic engineering.
Monoclonal antibodies have become the main type of antibody drug because of their high specificity and strong affinity to antigen.
However, with the intensive study of the natural monoclonal antibody, many defects have faced, such as the limit times of binding to antigen, the unanticipated antibody clearance and antigen accumulation.
Therefore, studies are no longer limited to the natural antibody screening, but rather to improve the efficiency of antibody drugs by engineering.
In recent years, the bottlenecks in the development of conventional antibody have been solved effectively since the discovery of a novel recycling antibody.
Recycling antibody binds to an antigen in plasma and dissociates from the antigen in endosome, thus maximizing the use of antibody and reducing antigen-mediated antibody clearance and antibody-mediated antigen accumulation. In addition, recycling antibodies can enhance the affinity with Fc receptors through further Fc modification.
This paper reviews the research progress of circulating antibodies, including its characteristics, transformation methods and prospects.
DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modification in eukaryotes.
In order to research genome-wide methylation levels and patterns in foxtail millet (Setaria italica), the Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) analysis (employing double digestion with EcoR I and Hpa II/Msp I) was established and applied in two foxtail millet cultivars (Chaogu 58 and Yugu 1).
The results showed that 32 pairs of MSAP primers were selected from 100 MSAP primers, and 1 615 and 1 482 clearly distinguishable and reproducible bands were amplified from Chaogu 58 and Yugu 1 respectively, including 3 types of methylation patterns. Cytosine methylation levels of CCGG context in Chaogu 58 and Yugu 1 were characterized as 6.93% and 8.77% respectively.
Such different genomic DNA methylation levels between two foxtail millet varieties may provide a preliminary reference for the cultivation of this crop from a novel epigenetic viewpoint.
