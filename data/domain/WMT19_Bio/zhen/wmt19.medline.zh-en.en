The international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma sponsored by International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2011, addresses the classification which is appropriate for resection specimens, small biopsies and cytology, respectively for the first time. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA); Invasive adenocarcinomas are recommended to be classified by comprehensive histologic pattern.
During the clinical practice, pathologists and clinicians have some confusions in understanding and application of to the new guideline to some extent.
This paper will interpret this new guideline, discuss and analyze the issues that need to be noticed in clinical application.
A 6-year-old patient with cerebral palsy was treated with Chinese scalp acupuncture.
The Speech I, Speech II, Motor, Foot motor and sensory, and Balance areas were stimulated once a week, then every other week for 15 sessions.
His dysarthria, ataxia, and weakness of legs, arms, and hands showed significant improvement from each scalp acupuncture treatment, and after 15 sessions, the patient had recovered completely.
This case report demonstrates that Chinese scalp acupuncture can satisfactorily treat a child with cerebral palsy.
More research and clinical trials are needed so that the potential of scalp acupuncture to treat cerebral palsy can be fully explored and utilized.
However, little is known about its use, effectiveness, and safety in the treatment of cutaneous lymphoma.
CASE REPORT Two patients with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (pT2bcNxM0 follicle center and pT2ac-NxM0 marginal zone) either declined or postponed recommended conventional treatment and received high-dose, fever-inducing mistletoe treatment; a combination of intratumoral, subcutaneous, and intravenous application was given; and one patient also underwent whole-body hyperthermia.
The lymphoma regressed over a period of 12 and 8 months, respectively, and after administration of a cumulative dose of 12.98 g and 4.63 g mistletoe extract, respectively.
The patients are in remission to date, 3.5 years after commencement of treatment.
Neither patient received conventional cancer treatment during the entire observation period.
Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative multimodal treatment system based on a holistic understanding of man and nature and of disease and treatment.
It builds on a concept of four levels of formative forces and on the model of a three-fold human constitution.
Anthroposophic medicine is integrated with conventional medicine in large hospitals and medical practices.
It applies medicines derived from plants, minerals, and animals; art therapy, eurythmy therapy, and rhythmical massage; counseling; psychotherapy; and specific nursing techniques such as external embrocation.
Anthroposophic healthcare is provided by medical doctors, therapists, and nurses.
A Health-Technology Assessment Report and its recent update identified 265 clinical studies on the efficacy and effectiveness of anthroposophic medicine.
The outcomes were described as predominantly positive.
These studies as well as a variety of specific safety studies found no major risk but good tolerability.
Economic analyses found a favorable cost structure.
Patients report high satisfaction with anthroposophic healthcare.
Nutrition therapy as part of lifestyle care is recommended for people with type 2 diabetes.
However, most people with diabetes do not follow this guideline.
Changing eating habits involves obtaining knowledge and building practical skills such as shopping, meal preparation, and food storage.
Just as fitness coaches use their specific knowledge base in fitness to enhance the effectiveness of their coaching, credentialed chefs trained as health coaches might combine their culinary expertise with coaching in order to improve clients' food choices and lifestyles.
This report documents the case of a 55-year-old white male physician, single and living alone, who was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and reported chronic stress, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy eating habits.
He participated in a chef coaching program of 8 weekly one-on-one 30-minute coaching sessions via Skype delivered by a chef trained as a health coach.
During the first five meetings, the patient's goals were primarily culinary; however, with his success in accomplishing these goals, the patient progressed and expanded his goals to include other lifestyle domains, specifically exercise and work-life balance.
At the end of the program, the patient had improved both his nutritional and exercise habits, his confidence in further self-care improvement, and his health parameters such as HgA1c (8.8% to 6.7%; normal <6.5%).
We conclude that chef coaching has the potential to help people with diabetes improve their practical culinary skills and implement them so that they eat better and, further, has the potential to help them improve their overall self-care.
We intend to further develop chef coaching and assess its potential as we learn from its implementation.
Heart rate variability, the change in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats, is an emergent property of interdependent regulatory systems that operates on different time scales to adapt to environmental and psychological challenges.
This article briefly reviews neural regulation of the heart and offers some new perspectives on mechanisms underlying the very low frequency rhythm of heart rate variability.
Interpretation of heart rate variability rhythms in the context of health risk and physiological and psychological self-regulatory capacity assessment is discussed.
The cardiovascular regulatory centers in the spinal cord and medulla integrate inputs from higher brain centers with afferent cardiovascular system inputs to adjust heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways.
We also discuss the intrinsic cardiac nervous system and the heart-brain connection pathways, through which afferent information can influence activity in the subcortical, frontocortical, and motor cortex areas.
In addition, the use of real-time HRV feedback to increase self-regulatory capacity is reviewed.
We conclude that the heart's rhythms are characterized by both complexity and stability over longer time scales that reflect both physiological and psychological functional status of these internal self-regulatory systems.
The association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma, although well established in adults, is less strong in the pediatric age group.
Benefits of proton pump therapy are limited across age ranges.
While there is a growing body of literature on the use of complementary treatments for both asthma and GERD, few studies have focused on treatment benefits for the GERD-asthma association.
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy with asthma and GERD who was not responding to inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids, beta-mimetic therapy, and a 6-week course of proton pump inhibitor treatment.
We noted a gradual disappearance of symptoms when he was given an oral preparation of Pulvis stomachicus cum Belladonna, an anthroposophic medication containing Matricaria recutita, Atropa belladonna, bismuth, and antimonite.
Matricaria recutita and bismuth have known gastric protective properties, and Atropa belladonna contains anticholinergic agents that have a bronchodilatory effect.
These complementary medications appear promising in terms of relieving the symptoms of GERD-associated asthma.
Circle dance, which derives from the tradition of folk dances, is practised worldwide.
This article explores the meanings participants attribute to it.
In-depth interviews with 39 participants, teachers and coordinators of teacher training programmes from the circle dance network in the United Kingdom were undertaken.
Applying a constructivist grounded theory approach, major categories, representing respectively the experiences of circle dance participants, teachers and coordinators, were developed.
This article specifically focuses on the first major category, termed "I can't imagine life without it", which relates to the experience of 22 dancers.
From an occupational perspective, the study reveals how participants realise a sense of meaning and satisfaction through engagement in circle dance and the potential contribution of this occupation to well-being.
A robust health infrastructure in every country is the most effective long-term preparedness strategy for global health emergencies.
This includes not only health systems and their human resources, but also countries' legal infrastructure for health: the laws and policies that empower, obligate and sometimes limit government and private action.
The law is also an important tool in health promotion and protection.
Public health professionals play important roles in health law - from the development of policies, through their enforcement, to the scientific evaluation of the health impact of laws.
Member States are already mandated to communicate their national health laws and regulations to the World Health Organization (WHO).
In this paper we propose that WHO has the authority and credibility to support capacity-building in the area of health law within Member States, and to make national laws easier to access, understand, monitor and evaluate.
We believe a strong case can be made to donors for the funding of a public health law centre or unit, that has adequate staffing, is robustly networked with its regional counterparts and is integrated into the main work of WHO.
The mission of the unit or centre would be to define and integrate scientific and legal expertise in public health law, both technical and programmatic, across the work of WHO, and to conduct and facilitate global health policy surveillance.
Methods: TMA system was established with TaqMan probes, specific primers, moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, and reaction substrates.
The sensitivity of TMA was evaluated by amplifying a group of 10-fold diluted HIV RNA standards which were transcribed in vitro.
A total of 60 plasma of HIV infected patients were measured by TMA and Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test to observe the positive rate. The correlation and concordance of the above two technologies were investigated by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.
Results: TMA system was established successfully and HIV RNA transcribed standards at concentration of equal or more than 10 copies/mL could be detected by TMA technology.
Linear regression was used for 46 samples which were positively detected by both TMA and Cobas reagents and showed an excellent correlation between the two reagents (r=0.997, P<0.001).
Bland-Altma analysis revealed that the mean different value of HIV RNA levels for denary logarithm was 0.02. Forty-four samples were included in 95% of credibility interval of concordance.
Conclusion: TMA system has the potential of high sensitivity.
TMA and real-time RT-PCR keep an excellent correlation and consistency in detecting HIV RNA.
To explore the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the expression of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) in peritoneal macrophages of septic mice and its possible mechanisms.
Methods: The mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured by conventional methods.The model of inflammation was established by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to incubate with mouse peritoneal macrophages. The PGE2, prostaglandin E receptor (EP) 4 agonist, EP4 RNAi, and DN.CREB inhibitory plasmid were used to interfere with the LPS-treated mouse peritoneal macrophage. The levels of HMGB1 was determined by Western blot.
Objective To compare the clinical effectiveness of lipoic acid combined with epalrestat versus lipoic acid in treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN).
Methods Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) and clinical controlled trials on lipoic acid versus epalrestat for DPN before February 2016 were searched through five databases:CNKI,CBM,VIP,Wanfang,and PubMed. The quality of the included trials were assessed using Cochrane software and Jadad scores. Data were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 software.
Results Nine studies were included in the analysis.
Meta analysis showed that the lipoic aid monotherapy was significantly inferior to lipoic acid-epalerestat combination therapy [RR=0.58,95%Cl(0.47,0.71),P<0.00001]. Inferiority of the lipoic acid monotherapy was also shown in nerve conduction velocity with WMDs of-4.94 [95%Cl(-7.41,-2.46),P<0.0001] for median motor nerve conduction velocity(MNCV),-5.08 [95%Cl(-7.68,-2.49),P=0.0001] for peroneal MNCV,-4.24 [95%Cl(-6.20,-2.29),P<0.0001] for median sensory nerve conduction velocity(SNCV),and-3.66 [95%Cl(-5.02,-2.31),P<0.00001] for peroneal SNCV.
Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust.
However,the included trials were limited by simple design,few subjective indicators,and short follow-up time.
Conclusions Lipoic acid combined with epalrestat is better than lipoic acid alone in the treatment of DPN,as well as the MNCV and SNCV of median or peroneal nerve.
To enrich the resource pool of endophytic fungi from plants which produce taxol, a taxol-producing endophytic fungus TMS-26 was isolated from the stem of Taxus Media.
The result of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that TMS-26 extract exhibited similar chromatographic peaks and retention time (4.545 min) with authentic taxol.
Then mass spectrometry (MS) analysis further confirmed that TMS-26 extracts contained the same mass peaks with authentic taxol ((M+Na)+=876). These indicated that the isolated endophytic fungus TMS-26 can produce taxol.
Millions of people, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, lack access to effective pharmaceuticals, often because they are unaffordable.
The 2001 Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopted the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement and Public Health.
The declaration recognized the implications of intellectual property rights for both new medicine development and the price of medicines.
The declaration outlined measures, known as TRIPS flexibilities, that WTO Members can take to ensure access to medicines for all.
These measures include compulsory licensing of medicines patents and the least-developed countries pharmaceutical transition measure.
The aim of this study was to document the use of TRIPS flexibilities to access lower-priced generic medicines between 2001 and 2016.
Overall, 176 instances of the possible use of TRIPS flexibilities by 89 countries were identified: 100 (56.8%) involved compulsory licences or public noncommercial use licences and 40 (22.7%) involved the least-developed countries pharmaceutical transition measure.
The remainder were: 1 case of parallel importation; 3 research exceptions; and 32 non-patent-related measures.
Of the 176 instances, 152 (86.4%) were implemented.
They covered products for treating 14 different diseases.
However, 137 (77.8%) concerned medicines for human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome or related diseases.
The use of TRIPS flexibilities was found to be more frequent than is commonly assumed.
Given the problems faced by countries today in procuring high-priced, patented medicines, the practical, legal pathway provided by TRIPS flexibilities for accessing lower-cost generic equivalents is increasingly important.
Zearalenone (ZEN) and its derivatives are non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxins mainly produced by Fusarium species. They are widely distributed in grain feeds originated from maize, barley, wheat and sorghum, causing serious harm to animal and human health. Currently, there is a pressing need of an efficient technology for ZEN degradation and detoxification.
IFN-λ1 is a member of a new family of interferons called type Ⅲ IFNs with similar functions to type ⅠIFNs.
Previously we obtained recombinant soluble human rhIFN-λ1 from Pichia pastoris.
However, the hyper-glycosylation from P. pastoris brings immunogenicity and low purification recovery rate.
To overcome this disadvantage, in this study, we constructed an rhIFN-λ1 mutant (rhIFN-λ1-Nm) devoid of the potential N-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis.
rhIFN-λ1-Nm was successfully expressed and secreted extracellularly in P. pastoris (GS115) using methanol inducible AOX1 promoter with α-mating factor signal sequence.
We analyzed estrogen concentrations and gene expression of estrogen-regulating enzymes in breast subcutaneous adipose tissue in premenopausal women with (n = 11) and without (n = 17) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
Estrone (E1) was the predominant estrogen in premenopausal breast adipose tissue, and E1 and mRNA expression of CYP19A1 in adipose tissue correlated positively with BMI.
Adipose tissue estradiol (E2) concentrations fluctuated during the menstrual cycle, similarly to the serum concentrations.
In women with breast cancer median adipose tissue E1 (1519 vs. 3244, p < .05) and E2 (404 vs. 889 pmol/kg, p < .05) levels were lower in the follicular than in the luteal phase whereas in control women no significant differences were observed.
In the follicular phase, mRNA expressions of HSD17B1 (median 0.06; interquartile range 0.05-0.07 vs. 0.17; 0.03-0.2, p = .010) and CYP19A1 (0.08; 0.07-0.14 vs. 0.22; 0.09-0.54, p = .025) were lower in women with breast cancer than in controls.
In conclusion, the changes in adipose tissue E1 and E2 concentrations and the estrogen-regulating CYP19A1 and HSD17B1 during the menstrual cycle may be related to dysfunctional local estrogen metabolism in women with breast cancer.
The elimination of hepatitis C virus(HCV) infection is still a long way to go.
Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) can make HCV completely cured by targeting various stages of its replication life cycle and meanwhile standardize and simplify the treatment.
However, those relative factors may affect efficacy and safety should be considered by specialties in choosing the suitable regimens.
In recent years, gene engineering is developing rapidly and many recombinant proteins have been expressed.
The use of plant bioreactor to express specific pharmaceutical proteins provides a new way for the prevention and treatment of some important diseases in human beings.
Nowadays, chloroplast genetic transformation and expression system has become a research hotspot in plant bioreactor.
Many important pharmaceutical proteins have been successfully expressed in plant chloroplasts.
As a chloroplast transformation model of higher plants, tobacco has made significant progress in the expression of pharmaceutical proteins, such as vaccine antigens, antibodies, and other important recombinant proteins.
Chloroplast genetic transformation in higher plants also provides new techniques and methods for the study of chloroplast gene expression and regulation mechanisms.
In order to provide a new idea for the development of chloroplast expression platform and the expression of important pharmaceutical proteins, this review outlined the progress of chloroplast genetic transformation system in higher plants, including the chloroplast transformation principle, vector construction, expression of recombinant proteins and important pharmaceutical proteins, and the effects of recombinant proteins expression on plant metabolism and traits.

Methods: Clinical data of 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma larger than 10 cm who underwent isolated caudate lobe resection from January 2001 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed.
Overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 80.2%, 52.1%, and 27.1%, respectively.
Conclusion: Isolated caudate lobe resection is safe and effective for caudate lobe huge hepatocellular carcinoma.
A Marfan syndrome child with contractural arachnodactyly deformity of both hands was admitted to our unit in June 2015.
The left and right middle fingers and ring fingers of the child received the continuous " Z" skin flap and " V-Y" plasty to reduce the palmar tension on the skin and release the contracture.
Due to the improper therapeutic strategy and the underestimation of effect of underlying lesions of Marfan syndrome on the therapeutic strategy, the right middle finger of child was with ischemic necrosis and amputated, and the finger tip was accompanied with distension and paroxysmal neuropathic pain at a specified future date. The skin flaps of the other three surgical fingers were with local necrosis and scar healing.
The child was complicated by distal interphalangeal joints stiffness and some serious complications post-discharge.
Combined with this case, the similar disorders are not recommended to carry out one-stage operation.
Von Hippel-Lindau(VHL) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease, and pancreas is one of the frequently involved intra-abdominal organs, including simple pancreatic cysts, pancreatic serous cystadenomas and neuroendocrine neoplasmas.
Most of the VHL-related pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasmas (VHL-pNEN)were non-functional, but they still have a tendency to be malignant. Treatment options for VHL-pNEN include regular follow-up, surgical resection, and medication therapy.
When compared with sporadic pNEN, the malignant degree of VHL-pNEN is lower, with a better prognosis, so the surgical treatment should be carefully considered.
The indications of surgery for VHL-pNEN include big primary lesions (≥3 cm), fast tumor doubling time (<500 days), VHL gene mutation on exon 3, malignant manifestations on imaging findings, and functional pNEN lesions.
The function-preserving approach should be performed to keep the functional pancreatic parenchyma as much as possible.
Even for patients with a late stage malignancy that cannot be radically resected, active medication therapy may still lead to a long-term survival.
The safety assessment of nanomaterials in food is essential for safeguarding supervision and maintaining public health.
However, there are still no safety assessment procedures for nanomaterials established in national-level in China and no specific toxicology and safety assessment procedures about nanomaterials for food, too. These factors lead to restriction on food safety protection and supervision.
Current methods of evaluating the safety of nanomaterials mainly rely on traditional toxicological assessment that are extrapolated based on animal experiment from high doses to low doses and from animals to humans. These uncertainties restrict the accuracy of safety assessment for nanomaterials and also limit the development of scientific and effective evaluation procedures and regulatory measures.
Currently, the key issues need to be solved including exposure assessment and evaluation methods of nanomaterials in food and the established methods of the toxicity test for nanomaterials that are consistent with the objectives of toxicity test in the 21st century vision and strategy.
In this article, we reviewed current administrative regulatory, situations, and existing issues of food nanomaterials either in China or some developed countries in order to provide a scientific basis in establishing safety assessment procedures for nanomaterials in food in the future.
The process of globalization increases the risk of global transmission of infectious diseases, resulting in pressure for country's prevention and control of imported infectious disease.
Based on the risk assessment of disease importation and local transmission, a strategy that conducting importation prevention and routine prevention and control before the importation of disease and taking emergency control measures after the importation of disease was developed.
In addition, it is important to take part in global infectious disease response action, aid the countries with outbreak or epidemic to actively decrease the risk of disease importation.
The researches on postmortem interval （PMI） estimation are very important and meaningful in forensic science. PMI estimation is also an important issue that must be solved in practice of forensic pathology.
There are many defects existing in traditional methods for PMI estimation, so it is imperative to introduce new pathways.
With the emergence of various new technologies, the researches on PMI estimation have a tendency from simple to complex with a growth of data.
The present review firstly summarizes a series of methods used for PMI estimation, and then gives an outlook for the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in this field.
Ischemic hepatitis, also known as hypoxic hepatitis or shock liver, refers to liver cell damage without any known cause of acute hepatitis, and is characterized by transient elevation of transaminase levels (20 times higher than normal value).The incidence of the disease is about 2.5% to 10%, and the hospital mortality rate is greater than 50%.
Current research suggests that there are many risk factors for the disease, including systemic hypotension, low cardiac output, sepsis and respiratory distress, but eventually it will manifest as hepatocyte dysfunction.
Unfortunately, the mortality rate related with hypotension is high, and the key to treatment is to correct hemodynamic disorders.
This article reviews the research progress in the etiology, mechanism and clinical manifestations of ischemic hepatitis.

Under the efforts of several generations, remarkable achievements have been made one after another.
This article mainly introduces the contribution of our department to burn medicine from five aspects as follows: critical burn treatment, wound repair, electric burn treatment, flap transplantation, and emergency rescue.
The 21st century is an era of information, technology, knowledge application, innovation, and globalization.
The purpose of education is not only to provide knowledge but also to extend knowledge across many disciplines and national and ethnic boundaries.
Education requires teachers to guide students to expand the depth and breadth of their learning and to make global connections.
The Executive Yuan's 2017 white paper on vocational education stresses that people in the technical and vocational education fields must adopt innovative thinking, be innovative in practice, and be prepared to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration.
Thus, teachers should make full use of these products to connect with their students, and creative teaching should promote knowledge transfer by using learning styles that Z-generation students prefer and by guiding students to extend their learned knowledge.
Education quality is a key indicator of national competitiveness. One way to improve competitiveness is to begin by understanding the experience of others.
This column invites nursing educators to share their experiences in creative teaching and international competition, with articles hopefully inspiring readers to explore and develop their own innovative thinking.
In the anterior tooth zone, the criteria of successful implant restoration is not only to ensure a high survival rate of implant, but also to provide long-lasting and stable aesthetic outcomes.
As for the rehabilitation of anterior teeth, immediate implant placement might achieve a survival rate similar to those of delayed implant placement and significantly reduce treatment time, whereas several aesthetic complications such as gingival recession, loss of interdental papilla, exposure of implant margin could also occur.
Therefore, an important issue need to be solved is that how to avoid or handle the aesthetic complications of immediate implant placement of anterior teeth.
This article mainly discusses the clinical features, possible etiologies and handling methods of aesthetics complications in rehabilitation of anterior teeth using immediate implant placement.
Methods: Fifty-one patients with ESCC and 55 healthy subjects from Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South Unicersity were selected for this study.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the level of miRNA-183 in serum samples. Chi-square test and correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between serum miRNA-183 level and clinical and pathological parameters of ESCC. Diagnostic efficiency of miRNA-183 and combined carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) examination for ESCC was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results: 1) The levels of miR-183 in the patients with ESCC (4.47±1.54) were elevated compared with that in the healthy subjects (2.03±0.96), with significant difference (t=9.700, P<0.01).
2) The levels of serum miR-183 in ESCC patients were significantly different among patients with different TNM stages (χ2=4.049, P<0.01), which was not affected by gender, age, smoking, drinking, tumor location, tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion and differentiation (all P>0.05). The levels of miR-183 were not associated with the serum CEA levels (P>0.05).
3) When the ROC curve analysis was used to diagnose ESCC with the optimal cutoff value of 4.502 for miR-183, the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval was 78.9%, 76.2%, 0.762 and 0.830-0.922, respectively.
When combined detection of serum miR-183 and CEA was used to diagnose ESCC, the sensitivity, specificity, AUC and 95% confidence interval was 82.3%, 92.6%, 0.877 and 0.814-0.935, respectively.
Conclusion: Serum miRNA-183 levels in ESCC patients may be increased, which can improve the diagnostic efficiency of ESCC when combined with CEA.
Serum miRNA-183 levels is related with tumor TNM stage, which contributes to the judgment of tumor progression and efficacy prediction.

To explore the effects of miR-21 on macrophage autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE).
Methods: The cells was divided into a control group, a CSE interventine macrophage group (CSE group), and a miR-21 inhibitor+CSE intervention macrophage group (miR-21 inhibitor+CSE group).
The expression of miR-21 in the 3 groups was detected by real-time PCR. The effects of miR-21 inhibitor on macrophage autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis were detected by Western blot, MTT assay and flow cytometry.
Results: Compared with the control group, the levels of miR-21 and autophagy in the CSE group were significantly increased (both P<0.05).
The expression of miR-21 in the miR-21 inhibitor+CSE group was significantly lower than that in the CSE group (P<0.05).
Conclusion: CSE intervention macrophage increase the autophagy and apoptosis of macrophages, decrease the cell proliferation by affecting the expression of miR-21 and the level of autophagy in macrophages.
Methods: A total of 130 glioma patients with confirmed pathological diagnosis were selected retrospectively from 2012 to 2017. Forty one imaging features were extracted from each subjects based on 2-dimension magnetic resonance T1 weighted imaging with contrast-enhancement.
An artificial neural network model was created and optimized according to the performance of feature selection. The training dataset was randomly selected half of the whole dataset, and the other half dataset was used to verify the performance of the neural network for glioma grading.
The training-verification process was repeated for 100 times and the performance was averaged.
Results: A total of 5 imaging features were selected as the ultimate input features for the neural network. The mean accuracy of the neural network for glioma grading was 90.32%, with a mean sensitivity at 87.86% and a mean specificity at 92.49%. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9486.
Conclusion: As a technique of artificial intelligence, neural network can reach a relatively high accuracy for the grading of glioma and provide a non-invasive and promising computer-aided diagnostic process for the pre-operative grading of glioma.
To explore the prognostic factors for patients with drug-induced liver failure (DILF) and construct a logistic regression model (LRM).
Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed in 183 hospitalized patients, who were diagnosed with DILF in Xiangya Hospital, the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from January 2009 to January 2018. The patients were divided into an improved group (n=67) and an ineffective group (n=116) according to their prognosis.
Univariate analysis was performed to screen for possible prognostic factors such as age, Tbil, SCr, PT and complications. According to the results of univariate analysis, the multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent prognostic factors and construct a LRM.
The LRM was compared with the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), the predictive value of LRM and MELD was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the parameters such as area under the ROC (AUC) and total accuracy were compared between the 2 models and verified by another independent sample.
Results: According to univariate analysis, there was significant differences in age, clinical type, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, WBC count, the ratio of aspartic acid transaminase (AST) to glutamine transaminase (ALT) (AST/ALT), Tbil, SCr, PT and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) between the 2 groups (all P<0.05).
Multivariate analysis revealed that: AFP, PT, AST/ALT, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome were independent prognostic factors for DILF, which could be applied to constructing a LRM.
The AUC of LRM and MELD was 0.917 (95% CI 0.876 to 0.959) and 0.709 (95% CI 0.633 to 0.786) respectively, the total accuracy rate of prediction for the LRM and the MELD was 86.7% and 68.3% respectively, there was significant difference in AUC and total accuracy rate between the LRM and the MELD (P<0.05).
Conclusion: AFP, PT, AST/ALT, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome were independent prognostic factors for DILF; the LRM can well predict the prognosis in the DILF patients, which is superior to the MELD.

The clinical phenotype of genetic liver disease is significantly different. Although the incidence of disease is low, because of the wide spectrum of diseases, the overall affected population is not rare. Therefore, clinical concern is a matter of alarm.
Additionally, these diseases rarity in clinical practice has covered the recognition, causing increased problem of clinical misdiagnosis. In accordance with the problems encountered in clinical practice of our hospital, we explore the clinical diagnosis of genetic liver disease.
Nowadays, more than 300 000 deaf people around the world benefit from cochlea implantation. With the extension of cochlear implantation indications, it has become a research focus for how to apply the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drugs safely and effectively to better retain residual hearing, as well as to protect hair cells and the spiral ganglion cells from apoptosis.
In this review, the methods of topical drug delivery to the inner ear are divided into four categories: transtympanic injection of liquid solutions, tympanic implantation of drug delivery systems, intracochlear injection and modified implant electrode. The results in each category and up to date progress are reviewed.
As a member of the Sirtuins family in mammals, SIRT7 locates in nucleus and is a highly specific H3K18Ac (acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3) deacetylase.
Recent studies showed that SIRT7 could participate in the ribosomal RNA transcription, cell metabolism, cell stress and DNA damage repair through various signaling pathways.
In addition, SIRT7 is also closely related with aging, heart disease and fatty liver.
In particular, SIRT7 plays important roles in the regulation of initiation and development of various tumors, such as liver cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, and head/neck squamous cell carcinoma.
This review describes the cellular and molecular functions of SIRT7, and systematically summarizes recent progress of SIRT7 in human disease.
A novel protein encoded by the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) was recently discovered in porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).
In the present study, the ORF4 was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pCMV-N-Flag-GST, yielding recombinant plasmid pCMV-N-Flag-GST-ORF4.
The recombinant plasmid was transfected into 293T cells and the intracellular interaction complex of ORF4 were enriched and separated by GST pull-down and SDS-PAGE, sequentially.
The potential interacting proteins of PCV2 ORF4 were stained with silver and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Finally, five candidate ORF4-interacting proteins, including Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit, alpha cardiac muscle 1, actin, SEC14-like protein 5 and myosin 9 were identified.
These results would benefit a better understanding of the biological function of ORF4 in PCV2 infected cells.
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] belongs to the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) family and possesses promising properties including biocompatibility and biodegradability.
In this study, we directly synthesized P(3HB-co-LA) with glucose by introducing the β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase from Ralstonia eutropha, the engineered propionate CoA transferase from Clostridium propionicum and the engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 2P24 into Escherichia coli. The polymer content was 83.9% (W/W), and the molar percentage of lactate reached 1.6%.
On this basis, in order to accumulate lactate, we reduced the activity of respiratory chain by deleting the ubiX gene, which is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme Q8. Moreover, we removed the dld gene to avoid the conversion of lactate to pyruvate during the fermentation. With these manipulations, the molar percentage of lactate in the polymer was improved to 14.1%, with an 81.7% (W/W) of polymer content.
The test results indicated that the strategy of reducing the activity of respiratory chain effectively increased the lactate units in the polymer, and it contributed a new approach to change the content of monomer components in the polymer.
Translocation ribonucleic acid (tRNA) is one of the important components in protein synthesis. In order to explore the effect of the changes of tRNAs corresponding to rare codons (rarity tRNAs) on the expression of exogenous genes, the co-expression system of rare tRNA gene and exogenous gene in Pichia pastoris was constructed.
The expression of GFP in P. pastoris can be greatly reduced when a repressor region composed of four continuous proline rare codon CCG was added into the GFP gene.
The expression amount of the repressed GFP could be increased about 4.9% when tRNAProCCG gene was cointegrated to the 3' of the repressed GFP gene through pPIC9K to the genome of P. pastoris GS115. Meanwhile, the expression amount of the repressed GFP increased about 12.5% by integrating the repressed GFP gene and tRNAProCCG gene to the genome of P. pastoris GS115 through pPIC9K and pFLDα, respectively. Using the same method, NFATc3T-GFP fusion gene and tRNAProCCG gene were co-expressed in P. pastoris GS115 resulting in 21.3% increased of the expression amount of NFATc3T-GFP fusion protein.
In conclusion, tRNAProCCG gene has been confirmed to be a kind of rare tRNAs in P. pastoris GS115. Through co-expression of tRNAProCCG gene and heterologous genes which containing the continuous rare codon CCG, the expression of the repressed heterologous genes could be increased significantly. Furthermore, this co-expression system would contribute to screening and determining the other rare tRNAs.
Defensins are endogenous cationic antimicrobial peptides rich in arginine and cysteine residues. They are important immune factors resisting pathogenic bacteria infection for mollusks.
The 43 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminal for Crassostrea gigas defensin (CgD) form its mature peptide region, responsible for the biological activity of CgD.
Antimicrobial assay showed that the culture medium supernatant containing recombinant CgDH⁺ and recombinant CgDH-, respectively, had activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that the existence of 6×His tag in the recombinant proteins do not affect their biological activities.
Thyroid tumors are one of the most common diseases, and the thyroidectomy surgery increases.
The outpatient surgery is the new trend in clinic. Is it suited for the thyroidectomy? In this article, we will analyse the setting of hospital, surgeon, surgery, patients, and so on, to prove the safety for the outpatient thyroidectomy.
In previous studies, we found that truncated rotavirus VP4* (aa 26-476) could be expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli and confer high protection against rotavirus in the mouse mode.
In this study, we further improved the immunogenicity of VP4* by polymerization.
In summary, the study in VP4* polymers provides a new strategy for the development of recombinant rotavirus vaccines.
To investigate the effect of 27nt-miRNA on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into vascular smooth muscle cells. The highly expression plasmids of 27nt-miRNA and anti-27nt-miRNA, and negative control plasmids were constructed, packaged with lentivirus and transfected into human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs). Collagen IV was added to induce hUCMSCs differentiation into blood vessel smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
Compared with the negative control group, the viability of the 27nt-miRNA overexpression group was decreased by 20.48% (P<0.05), and the expression of SMA mRNA and SM22α mRNA and protein was significantly increased (P<0.05); the viability of Anti-27nt-miRNA group was increased 18.07% (P<0.05), and the expression of SMA mRNA and SM22α mRNA and protein was decreased (P<0.05).
In summary, 27nt-miRNA promotes mesenchymal stem cells differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibits cells viability.
