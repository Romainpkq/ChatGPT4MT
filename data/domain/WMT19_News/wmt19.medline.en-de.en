Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects 2.5 million people worldwide.
Increased identification of causative gene defects and the increasing possibility of treatment necessitates better knowledge of phenotype-genotype correlations to help identify patients who would benefit from targeted gene therapy and improve patients' care.
Here, we report on three RP patients with mutations in the PDE6Β Gene that have not been described previously.
Three patients with a PDE6Β mutation were identified: 1. A 30-year-old male with a homozygotous mutation (c.[2351dupA],[2351dupA], p.[Q785Gfs*20],[Q785Gfs*20]) who was followed for 8 years.
2. A 54-year-old Caucasian woman with a heterozygous mutation [p.(K611Nfs*6), p.(Q567*)] who was followed for 40 years.
3. A 46-year-old Caucasian male [p.(E271K), p.(R627_E631del)].
All had noted an onset in childhood and complained of night blindness and photophobia.
Typical bone spiculae were seen, and peripheral visual fields were progressively affected in all patients.
Ganzfeld-ERG showed typical signs of rod-cone dystrophy.
Patients 1 and 2 underwent cataract surgery at ages 27 and 36 years with an improvement in vision, while patient 3 had not developed a cataract at age 54.
CONCLUSIONS
In children complaining of night blindness, a PDE6Β-associated RP needs to be taken into consideration.
Apart from helping patients with optical aids, such as polarizing filters or magnification, a specific diagnosis is especially important in view of emerging genetic treatment options.
In particular, in RP patients with a PDE6Β mutation, a phase I/II study is currently ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03328130).
Childhood trauma can have a negative impact on the development of personal and social resources in later adulthood.
This is problematic, because resources can be a protective factor against the development of psychiatric disorders and are potentially beneficial for therapy outcomes.
The current study considered the association between childhood trauma and resources as well as the impact of these 2 factors on psychopathology and symptom reduction in a psychiatric in-patient sample.
We anticipated negative relationships between resources and the extent of childhood traumatization as well as resources and psychiatric symptoms. We also expected a positive association between trauma and symptoms.
Furthermore, we assumed that higher current resources would be associated with a higher symptom reduction and more severe traumatization in childhood with a lower reduction of symptoms.
These hypotheses were tested with correlation and regression analysis in a sample of n=93 patients with depressive and posttraumatic symptomatology in a psychiatric clinic in Offenburg.
As expected, we found negative associations between resources and childhood trauma as well as resources and symptoms.
However, contrary to our predictions, we could only find a significant association between childhood traumatization and posttraumatic, but not depressive symptoms.
Also, there was no significant association between resources or childhood trauma and therapy outcome.
The reported associations are relevant concerning the prevention of psychiatric disorders and thus have multiple implications for the development and use of preventive and therapeutic interventions.
2 D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) is the latest evolution of elastography techniques and allows real-time quantitative assessment of the medium stiffness.
The aim of this review is to identify, describe, explain and illustrate some technical restrictions and artifacts in 2D-SWE.
Encountered artifacts and technical restrictions may be categorized according to acquisition technique, medium, or operator: · Acquisition technique: B-mode & SWE entanglement, transducer frequency, posterior elastographic shadowing artifact, mirrored elastogram artifact, "vertical striped" artifact, resolution limits in SWE, non-equivalence of elastographic devices.
· Medium: SWE in liquid medium, "black hole phenomenon", pseudo-liquid lesions, musculotendinous anisotropy, intrinsic stiffness variations of tendons and muscles, depth of analysis, movement artifacts.
· Operator: Region of interest compression, acquisition and measurement parameters (ROI size, ROI location, elastogram acquisition time).
Clear knowledge of the underlying physical basis is necessary in 2D-SWE because radiologists have to deal with technical restrictions and a wide range of artifacts.
Proper use of 2D-SWE ensures the reliability and reproducibility of the technique.
OBJECTIVE
RESULTS
The offers implemented were a success: The unemployed persons welcomed the consultations offered by job centres; the preventive health services specifically directed at unemployed persons that were provided by health insurance funds have proven successful, especially in terms of reducing stress and maintaining employability.
CONCLUSION
Inclusion of the key points of this approach into the basic recommendations at federal level (Bundesrahmenempfehlungen) of the National Conference on Prevention of 19 February 2016 has created a basis for further advances and dissemination.
Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is a life-limiting tumor with a wide range of incapacitating symptoms such as cancer-associated pain.
Several local ablative therapies with both thermal and non-thermal sources have recently received significant attention as modern treatment options for local tumor control and symptomatic improvement.
The following review article provides an overview of currently available techniques and their outcomes including our own experience with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) being one of the most exciting and innovative modalities.
METHOD
Our experiences with HIFU treatment are based on 89 pancreatic cancer patients (UICC III-IV).
RESULTS
Even though all strategies appeared to be feasible, the unique feature of noninvasiveness represents a substantial advantage of the HIFU procedure.
In 85 % of HIFU-treated patients, long-lasting pain relief was achieved. 50 % of patients did not require any analgesic treatment 6 weeks post-ablation.
Unfortunately, pain palliation and quality-of-life outcomes are only rarely reported for other local treatment modalities.
Various local ablative treatment modalities are available and feasible for tumor mass reduction of advanced pancreatic cancer but with different symptomatic benefit for patients.
An effective and long-lasting reduction of cancer-related pain was observed following HIFU without insertion of needles or electrodes.
Randomized controlled studies for head-to-head comparison of these modalities are warranted in the near future.
KEY POINTS
· Several ablative therapies are available for the local treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancer..
· Tumor mass and symptom reduction are main goals of local therapies..
· HIFU differs based on its noninvasive approach and low complication rate..
· HIFU enables effective long-lasting pain relief in > 80 % of patients..
· HIFU-associated pain relief is independent of tumor stage and metastatic status..

160 parents participated.
The results show, that parents feel statistical significant less overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent, recognise more capacity to act and support in everyday.
Qualitative data analysis reinforces these results and shows how the manual's concept supports parents' benefit from the intervention in their every day life.
Higher rates of missed pathologies, caused by a lack of professional experience or systematic search, suggest that a methodical approach to radiological analysis can be learned.
Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of different principles of screening stroke CTs for cerebrovascular diseases between radiologists and neuroradiologists with different levels of experience in relation to professional experience.
METHODS
A set of anonymous CT images of 20 patients, with a suspected stroke, was individually presented to 12 radiologists with different levels of professional experience.
Meanwhile, their fixation position was recorded by an eye-tracking system.
For statistical analysis, the interobserver variability and accuracy of lesion detection were evaluated, taking the individual level of professional experience into account.
RESULTS
The sensitivity of the observer depends on the professional experience, also determined by a systematic observation sequence and knowledge of the course of the disease.
The duration of eye fixation with inexperienced assessors was significantly longer for conspicuous findings, while experienced assessors were more likely to fix clinically relevant regions.
The retention time of ocular fixation in important pathological findings did not differ significantly between those groups.
CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that experienced radiologists are reducing the number of missed findings through a systematic approach and targeted inspection of important regions.
Through raising the awareness of analyzing CT images in systematic patterns, physicians at all levels of experience seem to be able to improve their performance.
KEY POINTS
· Experienced radiologists improve detection rates through targeted inspection of clinically important regions..
· Experienced radiologists reduce time spent on analysis through focused visual attention..
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We developed a training system that consisted of a game-based mobile rehabilitation application that is controlled by the patient's muscle signal, a tablet to play on, an electrode armband and a manual.
So far two patients have participated in this study.
They were asked to use the app for 4 weeks at home, 5 times a week, for 10 to 15 minutes.
The intervention was designed in a randomised controlled pre-test/post-test design and patients were measured for neuromuscular parameters before the intervention and afterwards.
RESULTS
After training with the app, a significant improvement (p < .
01) in all examined clinical parameters for myoelectric control of a prosthesis could be achieved.
The user statistics showed a high motivation to play the game and ran an additional diagnostic EMG-Test on one patient; the other participating patient, however, had played the game but neglected the EMG test and only completed half of it.
CONCLUSION
The training app not only provides instruction and feedback on the correct execution of myoelectric commands, but also maintains patient motivation through various game modes and feedback elements.
The rehabilitation process could be monitored and compared through an overview of training progress in the form of user statistics and high scores.
It could be shown that patients with upper extremity amputation could significantly improve their neuromuscular control, strength and coordination after using the game-based app so that they can fully benefit from the potential of a myoelectric prosthesis.
Standardised assessments of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are indispensable.
BODY-Q (A.
The BODY-Q was created pursuant to ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) standards and subjected to psychometric tests with great results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective evaluation of transvaginal (TV) and transabdominal (TA) scans performed in all singleton pregnancies with placenta previa totalis.
JS, i. e. the absence of the normal linear demarcation between the placenta previa and the cervix, was evaluated by TV scans.
RESULTS JS was noted in 8/39 (20.5 %) patients.
The two analyzed groups, i. e. with and without JS, were similar.
The specificity of JS in AIP diagnosis, histological findings of accreta/increta/percreta, need for caesarean hysterectomy or blood loss > 2000 ml ranges between 92 % and 96.2 %, with the PPV and NPV ranging between 71.4 % and 85.7 % and 61.3 % and 80.6 %, respectively. The JS group had a significant increase in blood loss (ml) (p = 0.003), transfusions (%) (p = 0.016), red blood cells (p = 0.002) and plasma (p = 0.002), admission to an postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) (%) (p = 0.002), hospitalization length (p < 0.001) and the need of cesarean hysterectomy (%) (p < 0.001).
JS was independently correlated to cesarean hysterectomy (OR 25.6; 95 % CI 2.0:322.3, p = 0.012) and blood loss > 2000 ml (OR 16.6; 95 % CI 1.5:180.1, p = 0.021) also in a logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION JS is useful in predicting the increase in maternal morbidity: massive transfusion, admission to the ICU and cesarean hysterectomy related to intraoperative bleeding in patients with a previa AIP.
Permanent loss of vision after a delay in starting therapy and the initiation of ineffective treatment are both serious risks.
The initial diagnostic classification is based on clinical presentation (anatomical localisation and type of inflammation) and clinical course and, secondarily, on the response to acute therapy. The aetiology is acute in as many as one third of cases.
The most frequent acute posterior uveitis in immunocompetent persons is acute viral retinal necrosis.
It is difficult to distinguish this clinically from Behçet uveitis, as long as there are no systemic manifestations.
In patients with disease threatening the macula, high dose steroid therapy must be started no later than 24 hours after the start of antiviral and anti-parasitic acute therapy.
Thus, misdiagnosis has therapeutic consequences. Moreover, the prognosis is favourably affected by aggressive treatment of acute posterior uveitis. Any delay in starting therapy increases infectious and inflammatory tissue damage, and increases the risk of involvement of the other eye and of other organs. On the other hand, the use of high doses of steroids, immunosuppressives and biological agents can lead to uncontrolled proliferation of the pathogen and relapses.
Due to new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), working at any time from any place has become possible.
Flexibility, availability and the dissolution of boundaries between work and private life are the possible results of this development.
The spread of this development and possible consequences on the affected employee's health and wellbeing have been examined so far especially in big companies.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are rarely subjects of scientific studies in this context.
OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER The aim of this work was to develop a guideline based on experiences and results of a study regarding flexibility in the business world (FlexA), as well as a systematic literature research.
METHODS
In order to delineate the current state in of research in ICT-related work interventions, a systematic review in data bases e. g. PsycINFO, EconLit and Medline was carried out.
In addition, grey literature and findings from the FlexA study were used to formulate the current guideline.
RESULTS
Based on the exclusion criteria, all studies from the systematic literature search were excluded after title and abstract screening.
Within grey literature research, 4 relevant publications could be identified.
The measures, developed during the corporate workshops of the FlexA study, e. g. the implementation of collective regulations in the company, were included in the guideline.
CONCLUSION
Due to the ongoing development of ICT and flexibility in daily business life, it is getting more and more important to follow this progress. Executives and corporate management are responsible to actively shape this trend in a health-promoting way in their enterprises.
However the standing of academic Plastic Surgery is particularly difficult.
METHODS
RESULTS
In 12 of 36 university hospitals there is no kind of Plastic Surgery established.
In 2015 participating 13 university hospitals treated 1476 interdisciplinary patients.
CONCLUSION
However integration of Plastic Surgery with its interdisciplinary responsibility in the common university curriculum will be a forward looking appreciation of Plastic Surgery.
The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disorder of the control of breathing in which repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep leads to frequent apneas/hypopneas with cyclic oxygen desaturation and arousals.
Sleep is fragmented and unrefreshing.
The affected patients suffer from an increased tendency to fall asleep, impaired concentration and a reduced quality of life.
The consequences of OSAS also include an increased risk of accidents caused by falling asleep as well as cardiovascular diseases.
The diagnosis of OSAS is based on a typical history and clinical examination.
Overweight, a large neck circumference and a narrow throat are conditions that may suggest an OSAS.
The diagnosis is confirmed by sleep examination.
The most important treatment for OSAS is the nightly application of continuous positive pressure (CPAP) via a nasal or mouth-nose mask, which usually leads to a rapid improvement of the symptoms.
Patients who do not tolerate CPAP therapy can be successfully treated with a mandibular advancement device.
Supporting measures are regular and sufficiently long sleeping times, avoidance of smoking and alcohol consumption in the evening as well as weight reduction for obese patients.
Nevertheless, this approach comes with several shortcomings, like the need for frequent intravenous infusions and the development of neutralizing antibodies in 20 to 30% of the patients with severe haemophilia A replacement.
This has led to the development of novel strategies to expand the spectrum of treatment options, some of which are based on antibody technology.
These include a bispecific antibody that bridges enzyme factor IXa and substrate factor X, monoclonal antibodies that block the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and a factor VIII-nanobody fusion protein with strongly enhanced von Willebrand factor binding.
In this review, functional and mechanistic considerations on the use of these antibody variants will be discussed.
[Utilization of Rehabilitation After Orthopedic Operation - Does Severity of Case Influence the Setting of Rehabilitation (Out- Vs. Inpatient)?] OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine which factors predict rehabilitation setting (inpatient vs. outpatient) after hospitalization in order to indicate the meaning of severity for access to a certain kind of rehabilitation.
METHODS
RESULTS
Patients from all surgery groups utilize more often inpatient rehabilitation, if they started treatment immediately after hospitalization than patients that start treatment after a period at home.
With increasing age as well as comorbidities patients use more inpatient rehabilitation.
The probability for inpatient rehabilitation decreased between 2005 and 2009.
CONCLUSION
For a demand-orientated access to a certain kind of rehabilitation, environmental conditions like support by family or accessibility to therapeutic, nursing or medical assistance and medical parameters like severity should be weighed against each other.
For example, soft contact lenses may be beneficial in the management of recurrent corneal erosions and advanced bullous keratopathy and may lead to disease attenuation in some conditions.
They also may be used in conjunction with surgical procedures to promote tissue healing and patient comfort in the postoperative period.
Rigid contact lenses may be beneficial in the setting of irregular astigmatism.
The present review of the literature will discuss the use of contact lenses in the management of corneal dystrophies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS/TECHNICAL BASICS
A VIST LAB simulator (Mentice, Gothenburg, Sweden), which has been continuously developed both in terms of software and hardware, has been in use since 2013. Recently, the simulator has been integrated into the angiography suite Azurion (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands).
RESULTS/AREAS OF APPLICATION
In student education there is the possibility for intensive examination of cerebrovascular diseases and their therapy in small group lessons.
The training of beginners in diagnostic and interventional angiography begins mandatorily on the simulator.
Research questions are the proof of validity and the training effect, but also the influence on patient safety and the possible cost reduction of an intervention.
CONCLUSION
As a result of continuous further development in recent years, simulators are now very well suited for both student teaching and beginner medical training.
In the future, even experienced interventionalists could benefit from further technical advances, which should also be driven by academic research.
Possible effects would be the reduction of examination times, complications and costs.
KEY POINTS
· Angiography simulators are useful in teaching students, medical training and research..
· Linking a simulator to an angiography suite increases the degree of reality even further..
· Real patient cases can be practiced and thus patient safety can be increased..
· Future developments should also increase the benefit for experienced interventionalists..
· Integration of simulators into certification programs (e. g. DEGIR) is to be targeted in the future..

For example it was found that in the same family with the same gene mutation patients with ALS, FTD or another neurodegenerative disease can be found.
The knowledge about the genes does not only contribute to the understanding of these diseases, but should help develop new therapeutic possibilities.
METHODS
100 tubes (n = 100) in 50 women were evaluated for tubal patency between November 2013 and July 2015 using ultrasound as index tests and laparoscopy as the reference standard.
Three different ultrasound techniques were applied: two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound using air + saline as the contrast media (2D-HyCoSy); two- and three-dimensional grayscale ultrasound using foam as the contrast media (2 D/3D-HyFoSy); and the same technique but adding bi-directional power Doppler (2 D/3D-Doppler-HyFoSy).
The videos containing full standardized exams using these three techniques were split into three parts, anonymized, encoded, randomized and reassessed in Nov. 2015 by two observers who assessed tubal patency using standardized criteria.
These observers were blinded to any clinical information and each other's results.
Proportions of observed agreement (po) and Cohen's Kappa (κ) including the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS
The inter-observer reliability/agreement in 2 D/3D-Doppler-HyFoSy (po = 0.99, κ = 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.93 - 0.97) was higher compared to 2D-air/saline-HyCoSy (po = 0.83, κ = 0.55, 95 % CI: 0.40 - 0.68) and 2 D/3D-HyFoSy (po = 0.92, κ = 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.54 - 0.76).
CONCLUSION
The inter-observer reliability and agreement of the diagnosis of tubal patency evaluating stored videos are improved when foam and power Doppler are used during acquisition.
Therefore, this technique may be preferred to minimize misclassification and misdiagnosis.
Ultrasound is the most commonly used diagnostic method in everyday clinical practice aside from conventional radiography.
For prospective physicians, there is a gap between the increased requirements in everyday clinical practice and the skills acquired thus far, especially when dealing with sonography.
In this work, we would like to present the structure of our sonography course and its implementation in the Ulm core curriculum of medical studies.
The sonography course is based on two pillars.
The Sonography Seminar (Pillar 1) has a lecturer who regularly conveys interdisciplinary theoretical content, fundamentals and possible fields of application for sonography during 13 appointments of 45 minutes.
The internship (Pillar 2) consists of four appointments of two hours each.
The groups of four students are supervised by a student tutor.
In addition to the technical basics and an introduction to the device customer, the organ systems liver, gallbladder and biliary tract, kidneys and adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, abdominal vessels and lymph nodes are mediated.
The focus is on the realistic exercises with high-end ultrasound equipment used in small groups with a final practical test.
The structure and procedure of the course was evaluated as being very positive by the students.
[Vascular Biomarkers in Retinal Vessel Analysis]. Modern non-invasive imaging procedures - including fundus photography and optical filming - can be used to investigate objective aspects of changes in the function and structure of retinal vessels.
The exact methodology of the evaluation and the designation of the parameters depend on the investigation.
Retinal vessel analysis has been employed in several cross-sectional and interventional clinical studies in ophthalmology and other specialities, including cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery, nephrology, gynaecology, sports medicine, diabetology, hypertensiology and others.
Static retinal vessel analysis is an inexpensive, reproducible, non-invasive technique, which can be used to make a prognostic statement on the vascular health of an individual patient.
Dynamic retinal vessel analysis possesses a broader spectrum of diagnostic applications than the static procedure, as it examines changes in vessel diameter continuously over time.
The use of several different methodological modalities for retinal vessel analysis together with their relevant quantitative biomarkers represents a promising approach for the evaluation of vascular diseases and cerebro- or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Interdisciplinary clinical application of these vascular biomarkers is becoming increasingly important in ophthalmology and other specialities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 100 consecutive patients with signs of obstructive sialadenopathy were evaluated.
The video recordings were sent to six colleagues with comparable experience without providing any further information about the patients' medical history and physical examination.
RESULTS
The overall agreement between the seven observers was substantial, with a κ of 0.765 for the 100 cases and a percentage agreement level of 88.29 ± 3.01 % (range: 83 - 94 %). The range of agreement on this video set for observer pairs varied from substantial to almost perfect agreement (0.663 to 0.878).
Among the few false-negative findings (5.4 %), 71.8 % were due to distal sialolithiasis.
Two-thirds of the false-positive findings (3.7 %) were due to fibrotic stenosis.
CONCLUSION
The study confirmed the diagnostic value of ultrasound in sialolithiasis and demonstrated a very high level of interrater agreement, even in the absence of additional clinical patient information, thus further underscoring the importance of ultrasound as the examination of first choice in sialolithiasis.
The Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon (HBP) is an unusual form of monocular vertical pendular nystagmus and is usually asymptomatic.
It always occurs in an eye with longstanding, profound visual loss.
Reports of HBP are few and HBP is probably underdiagnosed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
Eye movements were quantified, either from video or eye tracking recordings, in all patients.
The international literature on HBP was reviewed using the keywords "Heimann-Bielschowsky" or "monocular nystagmus".
RESULTS
In both our cases and those from the literature, VA was worse in the eye with HBP and was usually ≤ 20/200.
The eye movement was strictly monocular, pendular, mostly vertical, but sometimes oblique.
Characteristically, its frequency was irregular but low (0.2 to 2.6 Hz in our cases, 0.05 to 5 Hz in the literature) and its amplitude very variable (1 to 9° and 1.5 to 50°, respectively).
Extraocular movements were always preserved.
CONCLUSIONS
HBP is a benign monocular eye movement disorder that is always secondary to severe visual loss.
Being asymptomatic, HBP is still under-recognised and easily overlooked. Furthermore, both amplitude and frequency of HBP may be small and irregular.
Recognition of HBP is mandatory in order to prevent costly, unnecessary, and potentially hazardous investigations, and caution is advised, as cataract surgery might be responsible for postoperative oscillopsia.
Identifying early FD-specific pathologies is important in the context of maximum therapeutic benefit in these stages.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the value of quantitative cardiac T1 mapping as a potential disease-specific surrogate.
16 consecutive FD patients (9 female, 7 male; median age: 54 years, IQR 17) and 16 control patients (9 female, 7 male; median age: 52 years, IQR 20) were investigated at 1.5 Tesla.
Native T1 mapping was performed using a modified look locker inversion recovery sequence (MOLLI) and native T1 times were measured within the septal myocardium at the midventricular short-axis section.
Also functional parameters, left ventricular morphology, presence of late-gadolinium enhancement, cTnI- and Lyso-Gb3-Levels were evaluated.
RESULTS
The median native septal T1 time for FD was 889.0 ms and 950.6 ms for controls (p < 0.003).
Assuming a T1 cut-off value of 900 ms for the identification of increased cardiac lipid deposit, 9 patients with FD (56.25 %) had pathologic values (4 patients cTnI and 8 patients Lyso-Gb3 positive).
Moreover, native septal T1 showed a good negative correlation to Lyso-Gb3 (r = - 0.582; p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION
A pathologic cardiac native T1 time obviously reflects cardiac involvement in the scope of FD at tissue level.
In the future native T1 mapping as an imaging biomarker might allow identification of early stages of cardiac involvement in FD before morphological changes are obvious.
KEY POINTS
· Native T1 values are significantly decreased in Fabry disease..
· Native T1 shows promising correlation to cardiac and Fabry-specific biomarkers..
The present article discusses challenges and necessary measures from the perspective of young professionals.
The authors argue that public health education and training in Germany needs to be strengthened and reformed.
Moreover, Germany's public health community must create and strengthen structures and processes needed to make its voice heard more strongly in politics and society, including an effective professional organization.

What Role Does Synovitis Play in Craniomandibular Dysfunction (CMD)?
A 3T-MRI Study.
This study aimed at analyzing changes in patient characteristics as well as indications for in- and outpatient emergency care between 2009 and 2015 and their potential reasons.
METHODS
Using generalized linear models (GLM), we examined regional shifts in emergency cases being treated in ambulatory and inpatient settings.
RESULTS
Between 2009 and 2014 the number of cross-sectoral ambulatory emergency cases increased by 4 % (in emergency departments an increase by 42% with the highest incidence rate ratio (IRR) in the 20-34-year-old age group).
Inpatient emergency cases increased by 20% with older patients representing the largest group.
CONCLUSIONS
Indications that are treated in physician practices and emergency outpatient clinics and those that lead to hospital admissions point out the potential for managing patient care appropriately.
Patient behaviors in healthcare utilization can be addressed by interventions for specific patient subgroups.
However, a prerequisite for the development of such measures is the inclusion of a cross-sectoral perspective in the system of emergency care.
This is regulated at the level of transcription.
Crucial here are the so-called master genes or DNA-binding transcription factors PAX6, FOXC1, SOX2, FOXE3, OTX2, PITX2 and PAX2.
Depending on the disease phenotype, it is possible to conclude on the gestational period in which ocular development was profoundly disrupted.
The so-called neural crest cells contribute significantly to the development of eye structures, especially of the anterior segment.
The review first presents a brief overview of the embryologic development of ocular structures and then describes major profound developmental disorders of the eyes: phenotypic and genetic features in the MAC spectrum (microphthalmia, anophthalmia, coloboma) as well as anterior segment dysgenesis (Axenfeld-Rieger spectrum, aniridia, Peters anomaly). It also outlines the systemic involvement of these diseases.
In clinical and genetic diagnostic pathways, the determining factor is the exact phenotypic characterization that must be preceded by any genetic diagnosis and the further choice of diagnostic options.
"Shotgun diagnostics" on all of the described genes involved in ocular developmental disorders is costly and less effective than a phenotypically-oriented selection of the genes common to the phenotypical syndrome described, and only then should it be followed by the analysis of rarer genes in a second or third molecular genetic step.
With adult patients, meshes are being increasingly used.
The purpose of our study was to analyse Spitzy herniotomy with respect to the recurrence rate in children and adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Over a period of 7 years, 383 children (age < 16 years) with umbilical hernia were treated surgically; after applying the exclusion criteria, 370 patients were evaluated.
At the same time, 106 adult patients (age > 16 years) were operated for an umbilical hernia: 31 patients were treated with direct suture and thus are included in our study as comparison group.
RESULTS
The young patients had an average age of 33.81 months and were 44% female and 56% male.
After direct Spitzy suture, a low recurrence rate of 1.1% (n = 4) in infancy could be achieved.
The average age of the adult patients was 54.55 years; 32% were female, 68% male.
In comparison to the group of children, the recurrence rate in adult surgery was 12.9% (n = 4) after direct suture.
CONCLUSION
As confirmed in our study, umbilical herniotomy by direct suture in childhood has been the method of choice and gold standard for more than 100 years.
Mesh implantation is still not necessary in childhood.
The collateral status can be defined not only by its morphological extent but also by the velocity of collateral filling characterized by the relative filling time delay (rFTD).
The aim of our study was to compare different methods of noninvasive visualization of rFTD derived from 4D-CT angiography (4D-CTA) with digital substraction angiography (DSA) and to investigate the correlation between functional and morphological collateral status on timing-invariant CTA.
50 consecutive patients with acute occlusion in the M1 segment who underwent DSA for subsequent mechanical recanalization after multimodal CT were retrospectively analyzed.
4D-CTA data were used to assess the relative filling time delay between the A1 segment of the affected hemisphere and the sylvian branches distal to the occluded M1 segment using source images (4D-CTA-SI) and color-coded flow velocity visualization with prototype software (fv-CTA) in comparison to DSA.
The morphological extent of collaterals was assessed on the basis of the Collateral Score (CS) on temporal maximum intensity projections (tMIP) derived from CT perfusion data.
RESULTS
There was very good correlation of rFTD between fv-CTA and DSA (n = 50, r = 0.9, p < 0.05).
Differences of absolute rFTD values were not significant.
4D-CTA-SI and DSA also showed good correlation (n = 50, r = 0.6, p < 0.05), but mean values of rFTD were significantly different (p < 0.05). rFTD derived from fvCTA and CS derived from timing-invariant CTA showed a negative association (R = - 0.5; P = 0.000).
In patients with a favorable radiological outcome defined by a TICI score of 2b or 3, there was a significant negative correlation of CS and mRS at 3 months (R = - 0.4, P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION
Collateral status plays an important role in the outcome in stroke patients. rFTD derived from 4D-CTA is a suitable parameter for noninvasive imaging of collateral velocity, which correlates with the morphological extent of collaterals.
Further studies are needed to define valid thresholds for rFTD and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value.
KEY POINTS
· Collateral supply in anterior circulation stroke can be defined by the velocity of collateral filling.
· Relative filling time delay (rFTD) can serve for quantitative measurement of collateral flow and correlates with the morphological extent of collaterals.
Appropriate prophylaxis as well as early diagnosis and treatment are therefore mandatory.
However, anticoagulation of cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and recurrence.
To meet these challenges, national and international guidelines for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer have been published.
We provide a summary of these specific recommendations.
Trabeculectomy for the surgical reduction of internal eye pressure is an established procedure, but the principle limitations are in postoperative wound healing.
Various antimetabolites are regularly used to avoid postoperative subconjunctival scarring.
The present study investigates whether the combination of an Ologen implant with bevacizumab can modify the rates of success and/or complications during trabeculectomy.
METHODS
Three different groups of patients were evaluated in which trabeculectomy was performed with mitomycin C, either alone (group 1) or in combination with an Ologen implant (group 2) or with an Ologen implant with bevacizumab (group 3).
The success and failure rates, changes in tension, postoperative complications and postoperative revision for pressure regulation were evaluated.
The follow-up was 12 months for all eyes.
RESULTS
The number of substances applied preoperatively to reduce intraocular pressure was 2.89 ± 0.98 and the internal ocular pressure was 21.74 ± 5.49 mmHg. Twelve months postoperatively; the mean pressure was 13.14 ± 3.71 mmHg. The greatest absolute success rate (= IOD ≤ 15 mmHg without antiglaucoma medication) was in the group with exclusive goniotrepanation + mitomycin C (MMC; 72.5%), followed by the groups with Ologen (67.5%) and Ologen + bevacizumab (63.6%).
The greatest failure rate (= IOD > 15 mmHg) was in the Ologen bevacizumab group (17.3%), followed by the pure Ologen group with 22.5% and the pure trabeculectomy group (12.3%).
There were no significant differences in the success and failure rates.
There were no serious intra- or postoperative complications in any group.
The number of patients for whom it was necessary to loosen the traction thread was significantly lower in the sole Ologen group (p = 0.02).
There were also no significant differences between the groups with respect to revisions.
CONCLUSION
Using Ologen as drug depot for bevacizumab in a trabeculectomy (TE) with MMC is a safe and active surgical method without an increased risk of complications in comparison to pure TE with MMC or TE with MMC and Ologen implant.
Light pollution by widespread illumination of our environment and the night sky and uncontrolled man-made use of any light source plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sleep disturbances.
In this article a few key facts concerning light, sleep and diseases are presented. We should by all means account for the effects of light and darkness and stop any further light pollution.
PAD patients often suffer from multiple diseases. Consequently, therapy is commonly complex and requires an interdisciplinary approach.
Because of rapid technical developments, interventional endovascular therapy regimens play an increasingly important role.
METHOD
Review and literature search on the basis of the current German S3 guidelines on the therapy of PAD as well as international guidelines.
In terms of state-of-the-art therapies, relevant current studies were considered.
RESULTS
Knowledge of existing guidelines and recommendations as well as new therapeutic approaches is essential for the adequate therapy of PAD patients.
A close cooperation between the interventional radiologist and the vascular surgeon is the key to success.
CONCLUSION
A primarily endovascular-first strategy has become the standard in the majority of even complex lesions of the lower extremity arterial system.
Further evidence can be expected from ongoing randomized multicenter trials.
KEY POINTS
· Adequate diagnostic examination is essential for the classification and strategy of therapy in PAD.
· Therapeutic decisions are ideally made in an interdisciplinary conference.
· Interventional therapy of intermittent claudication after exhaustion of conservative and medicamentous therapy.
· Endovascular-first approach in supra- and infrainguinal lesions.
· Additional evidence expected from future randomized trials.

To ensure that antibiotics will remain a reliable option for treating infectious diseases, targeted action is needed in various fields.
The studies showed heterogeneity in terms of endpoint definitions (CLABSI), details of the implemented measures, and evidence of a publication bias favoring the use of of preventive bundles.
The majority of previous studies shows that migrants use medical rehabilitation less often than non-migrants.
In some cases, opposite results have been reported.
Previous research, however, has different limitations.
The present study examines the use of rehabilitation among migrants and non-migrants by means of the Third German Socio-medical Panel of Employees (GSPE-III).
METHODS
The study is based on the first wave of the GSPE-III, extended by administrative data from the insurance accounts of the respective study participants.
The survey was conducted in May 2013 and comprises a risk cohort of insurants of the German Statutory Pension Insurance Scheme (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund) who are at risk of reduced social participation and who received sickness benefits in 2012. We compared non-German nationals, German nationals with a migration background and German nationals without a migration background.
Based on the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model, the quality of life, the self-perceived risk of a reduced earning capacity as well as demographic and socio-economic factors were taken into account as covariates using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS
Of the 2,413 respondents surveyed, 2.7% were foreign nationals and 4.4% were German nationals with a migration background.
As compared to Germans with no migration background, Germans with a migration background and non-German nationals did not significantly differ in their utilization of rehabilitation (adjusted odds ratio=0.78, 95%-CI=0.47-1.30 and adjusted odds ratio=0.99; 95%-CI=0.53-1.88, respectively).
CONCLUSION
The GSPE-III allows overcoming some limitations of previous studies by means of detailed data on migration background as well as the possibility to consider confounding factors at different levels and to link survey with routine data.
The results contradict the majority of previous studies and show that epidemiological research on the utilization of rehabilitative care among migrants is inconsistent.
For the interpretation of the present findings, it is also necessary to take into account the special properties of the GSPE-III and the comparatively small sample size.
Graves' orbitopathy is the most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease.
In the burnt out fibrotic phase exophthalmos, diplopia and lid retraction may remain, which can require multiple rehabilitative surgical interventions.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of the deep lateral orbital wall decompression including the orbital rim.
In this retrospective, non-comparative case series, all patients with Graves' orbitopathy, who underwent lateral orbital wall decompression at the Eye Clinic of the University of Göttingen between 2008 and 2015, were analysed in terms of exophthalmos reduction, diplopia (Gorman score) and complications.
RESULTS
127 patients who underwent 195 orbital decompressions were included.
Preoperatively, 47 patients/77 orbits (37.0/39.5%) presented without diplopia.
Postoperatively, 3 patients/3 orbits (6.4/3.9%) showed new-onset diplopia (2.4% of all patients, 1.5% of all orbits).
Diplopia in primary gaze was noted in one of the 3 patients (0.8% of all patients, 2.1% of patients without preoperative diplopia), and inconstant diplopia was seen in the other 2 patients.
Postoperative improvement of diplopia was noted in 19 patients/19 orbits (15.0% of all patients, 23.8% of patients with preoperative diplopia/9.7% of all 195 interventions), and 16.1% of cases with preexisting diplopia.
No severe complications were seen, except for one case of postoperative bleeding, which was successfully managed surgically without any functional deficits.
A visible scar formation was noted in 6 cases (3.1%), temporal hollowing in 3 cases (1.5%), oscillopsia when chewing in 3 cases (1.5%) and a de-insertion of the lateral canthal region in 2 cases (1%).
CONCLUSIONS
Postoperative haemothorax following thoracic surgery is a rare complication, but associated with a high mortality.
In severe cases, re-thoracotomy is mandatory.
The most frequent origin of bleeding is a bronchial or intercostal vessel (21 and 16%) or the area of pleural adhesions that were separated (10.5%).
The pulmonal artery or vein were the origin of bleeding in 16% of cases while in most cases (37%) active bleeding could no longer be detected.
When unaccompanied minors (UMA) are taken into provisional care by the youth welfare offices, it is legally obligatory to carry out an initial medical examination and obtain a statement as to whether the state of health of minors excludes the implementation of the distribution procedure according to the Königsberg Key and, in the case of 15-year-olds and non-pregnant persons, an X-ray thorax scan to exclude infectious tuberculosis of the lungs.
The supreme state health authorities of the German federal states determine the further scope of the investigations.
The aim of this nationwide survey is a comparison of the different concepts of the individual states with regard to the scope of the initial UMA investigations.
METHODS
Between September 2016 and May 2018, a survey on the scope of the UMA initial investigations was conducted by e-mail with official contact persons.
At the same time, a web-based search of the websites of the supreme health authorities of the federal states for official statements was carried out.
RESULTS
In the areas of TB screening of under 15-year-olds and pregnant women as well as screenings for other diseases, the picture across Germany was sometimes very mixed.
There was agreement above all in the recommendations for vaccination.
CONCLUSION
Efforts to harmonise the scope of the investigation at the federal level should be pursued further.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The survey was performed from 2017/01/01 until 2017/04/30 and recruited inpatients of a university department of trauma surgery. The questionnaire contained 10 multiple choice questions targeting socio-demographic factors and the motivation of the patients to participate in different aspects of medical education.
RESULTS
In total 162 questionnaires were analysed.
There was a positive correlation between the satisfaction with the motivation to participate in bedside teaching and a student examination as well as giving consent to the collection of pictures, videos and X-ray images or subsequent contact.
There was significantly decreased motivation for participation in a lecture.
Moreover 40- to 49-year-old patients were significantly less motivated to participate in a lecture than 20- to 29-year-old and 50- to 59-year-old patients.
Patient satisfaction had no influence on motivation to participate in a lecture.
CONCLUSION
Socio-demographic factors are less important.
Patient motivation to participate in a lecture is lower regardless of patient satisfaction.
Neuronal blood pressure control is mediated by the autonomic nervous system.
In this article, physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms will be recapitulated.
Blood pressure regulation aims at maintaining adequate cardiac output and a sufficient perfusion pressure for the organs.
In glaucoma, ocular perfusion pressure is defined as the difference between systemic blood pressure and intraocular pressure and is crucial for the supply of the optic nerve.
Patients who suffer from normal-tension glaucoma and low blood pressure are at risk of glaucoma progression.
In primary open-angle glaucoma, blood pressure is also of importance.
A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with particular attention to the nocturnal dipping is recommended for all glaucoma patients.
Internal medicine specialists and ophthalmologists should be aware of the mutual influence of the two diseases and take this it into account for the choice of an individual therapeutic strategy and target level.
It was examined, whether the parents show characteristics of "sensory processing sensitivity" (SPS) such as extraordinary perception and processing, hypersensitivity to external stimuli, increased excitability and excessive demands.
The comparison of 44 parents with atopic disposition with 20 non-atopic parents showed a significantly higher sensitivity, excitability, a stronger propensity for esoteric thinking and a reduced frustration tolerance in the parents with atopic disposition.
There were no significant differences between atopically predisposed parents of slightly ill children and atopically predisposed parents of seriously ill children.
CONCLUSIONS Atopically predisposed parents of children with atopic dermatitis show properties according to the construct of "sensory processing sensitivity" (SPS).
The influence of these properties on children with atopic dermatitis, in particular the increased responsiveness (Aron & Aron 1997, Boterberg & Warreyn 2016), should be investigated in further studies.
To meet the need for measures of symptom control at the interface between genuine urologic and general palliative care, it is necessary for the partners from special outpatient palliative care (SAPV), general outpatient palliative care (AAPV), medical centres and other service units to cooperate.
There are a significant number of urological practitioners who have completed trainings in palliative care or passed an exam as 'qualified palliative physician (QPA)'.
A viable cooperation requires timely, standardised documentation in an internet-based system as well as defined strategies for the provision of care.
Normal tension glaucoma is a variant of primary open angle glaucoma. It is characterized by normal intraocular pressure.
Although there are several pathophysiological explanations (e. g. vascular dysregulation, the role of the lamina cribrosa), none of these explanations can fully explain its pathophysiology.
The optic nerve is a white matter tract of the brain.
It is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid on its whole length.
Neuroradiological examinations hint at a neurodegenerative origin of normal tension glaucoma.
Impaired cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and reduced clearance of Aβ amyloid might play a role in this process.
The lymphatic and the glymphatic system are thought to be essentially involved.
Adenotonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in Germany and the most critical postoperative complication is postoperative hemorrhage, particularly for children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In a retrospective anonymous examination over a 4 - year period the data of children and adolescent patients subject to surgery of the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring were recorded.
Based on the preoperative questionnaire of the blood coagulation history and the laboratory chemical screening, risk factors for hemorrhage as well as for von Willebrand Disease (VWD) were identified.
RESULTS
Included in the examination were 171 male and 137 female patients. Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 43 children (14 %) between the 1st and 13th day after surgery.
Children with frequent epistaxis had a significant higher risk of postoperative hemorrhage.
CONCLUSIONS
In case of a conspicious family history, especially of the mother in the bleeding questionnaire, a significantly increased risk for VWD could be observed.
Here it is advisable to determine the PTT as well as PFA-100 and, to continue with a further VWD step-diagnostics.
